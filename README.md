Eleventy Blog using markdown as source of content. I wanted to be able to compare Eleventy with Gatsby in terms of development and content writing.


## TO DO LIST

- [x] Service Worker with notification that there is an update for the user so they can refresh the content if out of date
- [x] Decent Font
- [x] Better design
- [ ] Look at getting data from Strava when build happens
