Running: Sunday is (now) the day when I do my "long run". I ran the route that I used to cycle back in the days when I cycled with my parents and family friends every Sunday. A lot of running along along pavements before hitting the woods where there is a mixture of trail and dirt-path. [Route: "Lookout 10"](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=861534). This is the furthest I've run since the 1/2 marathon last summer (Norwich 1/2 marathon) and the second furthest I've run EVER. Woot!!! Distance: 10.03 miles in 78 mins. Pace:7m48s / mile. I ran this as an easy/moderate pace where I went quicker on the hills, especially the final climb back to my house:> This evening I am quite knackered. The weather the last couple of weeks has been exceptionally warm/sunny and today was no different. I thus left home at 1845. Cool/cold and a fantastic sunset.
