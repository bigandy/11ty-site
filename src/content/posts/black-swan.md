Running: after a wet sodden weekend of [walking in the Cotswolds with the family](http://big-andy.co.uk/Photos/cotswolds07/index.html) today was the first day back at work, first day back running since last Weds as I had to go out today. None of this football malarkey today for me. "Reverse River" in 37 minutes. Nirvana helped lower the time especially in the final run into work. Got a nasty sore throat but am drinking lots of fluid so hopefully will kick it's arse and be fine soon. What the fuck is happening with cycling recently? First the 1996 Tour de France winner Riis says he won the tour on EPO then multiple Green Jersey winner Eric Zabel admitted that he tried EPO in the 1996 Tour. On the +ve side of cycling: Mark Cavendish won his second stage at the Volta a Catalunya (a pro tour race) in another sprint gallop finish.
