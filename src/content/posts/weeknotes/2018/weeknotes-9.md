-   Joined the gym last Monday and have been 3 times in total (including before work today) - aiming to go 2x a week - Mon and Weds.
-   Walked to Wallingford just avoiding the torrential downpour on Saturday
-   Walked around Cholsey on Sunday including seeing Agatha Christie's gravestone
-   Went to #ffconf in Brighton last Friday
