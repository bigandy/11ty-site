-   Gym twice a week - Weds after work, Fri before work - at the moment I prefer to go before work but it does mean getting up earlier.
-   Running on Sunday - really muddy, lovely to get outside after all the time in the gym on the machines.
-   Went to Swindon to the designer outlet to get some clothes. Arthur loved the train ride round the shops.
