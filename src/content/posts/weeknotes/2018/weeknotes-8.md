This week was a busy one.

-   We went to France for my brother-in-law's wedding each way taking 3 seperate trains and two different taxis - with two kids it was exhausting!
-   It was my birthday and Marion and I went out for a nice dinner in Wallingford
-   Fireworks display at Cholsey Meadows
-   Visited my Bro in London
