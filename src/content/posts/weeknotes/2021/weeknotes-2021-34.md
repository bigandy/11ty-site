-   A final week of working from France before we drove back to the UK

-   We drove back to UK from France on Saturday. We left La Rochelle at 8am (on schedule!) and arrived in Caen at 1400. Our route was via Le Mans and they were doing the 24 hour race but there was no traffic on the road so we were lucky. Otherwise plain sailing all the way to the North coast. We sat on the grey beach, had some lunch and then an ice-cream. Then check-in, join the many queues, and finally sit on deck and the sun comes out. C'est la vie!

-   Spent the rest of the weekend recovering, seeing friends, and had an amazing Indian take-away for dinner.
