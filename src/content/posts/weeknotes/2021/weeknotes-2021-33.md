Again this year we are in France for the majority of our summer. We are staying at Marions parents and also spent a week in the Pyrenees and a week with friends here on the West Coast of France.

### Highlights

-   Week in Pyrenees with beautiful scenery and mountains. Marion and I did a day-long hike to the top of a mountain.
-   Week with friends and their kids and trips to the beaches on ile de Re
-   Running in the mornings with Marion
-   Delicious food and drink
