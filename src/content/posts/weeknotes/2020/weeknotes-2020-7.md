- **Running**: Three runs in three days (Mon, Tue, and Wednesday) and then a short run on Sunday.

- **Solo Parenting**: Marion was in South Africa with work so I was solo parent for the week from Sunday afternoon until Saturday morning. The children were well behaved but Arthur woke up a lot in the night, and Emma always wakes up before 6. I was exhausted by the end of the week!

- **Reading**: I finished reading ["The Best Interface is No Interface"](http://www.nointerface.com/book/) and ["To Have and Have Not"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Have_and_Have_Not) by Ernest Hemingway. I started reading the second book of the Three Body problem Trilogy ["The Dark Forest"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest).

- Exercise: Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday. 32 Vitality Points.
