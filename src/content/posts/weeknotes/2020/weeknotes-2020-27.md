-   On Sunday we met my parents at Beale Park and enjoyed our first trip there since last year. The animals were great and the kids had great time. The weather was sunny and we had a picnic on the grass and then an ice-cream later. Perfect!

-   I ran four times this week which took me over 20 miles for the first time since March.

    -   Mon: [Field River](https://www.strava.com/activities/3686789894)
    -   Tue: I ran a [fast-ish 10k](https://www.strava.com/activities/3694411453) in the evening (I had to get back so Marion could go out, nothing like a deadline to make you run faster!)
    -   Thu: [Cholsey River](https://www.strava.com/activities/3703278820)
    -   Sun: [Ridgeway Cox's Lane](https://www.strava.com/activities/3715415298)

-   **Reading**: I finished reading ["Caught Inside"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Caught-Inside-Surfers-California-Coast/dp/0865475091/) which describes a year surfing the waves of California, as well as the wildlife and the characters the auther meets during this time; pretty enjoyable.

-   Exercise: Running four times. Walk with friends.
