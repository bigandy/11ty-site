-   **This week was**: The second week of looking after Emma and Arthur. Much the same as last. The clocks went forward an hour and Emma has been sleeping a bit longer in the mornings. I received four editions of B Magazine an excellent Korean brand-focused magazine that focuses each edition on a particular brand. So for I have: Freitag, Mont Blanc, Helvetica and Lego (Arthur loves this one!). I ordered some Timtams from Amazon. Daily walk or PE session with Joe Wicks Youtube.

The final three days of the week I did a ~4 mile run which was great, some me time!

-   **Reading**: I finished reading the final book of the Three Body Problem Trilogy ["Deaths's End"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death%27s_End). It was great except for the final 25% which was weird. Then I continued reading ["Killing Commendatore"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38820047-killing-commendatore) by Haruki Murakami which is super heavy and long (~700 pages) after not being able to get into it before. Now seems like a good time to read it!

-   Exercise: Running Friday, Saturday and Sunday. PE or walked most other days. 40 Vitality Points.
