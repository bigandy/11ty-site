-   Holy smokes Emma slept until 0740 on Thursday, which was super great but I still woke up at 0610 and got to read my book and - then later - have breakfast with Arthur.

-   Marion and I celebrated our wedding anniversary and had an excellent take-away from the Italian place in town.

-   On Saturday we walked around Queensford Lakes and had a delicious brownie and coffee at [The Wandering Kitchen](http://thewanderingkitchen.co.uk/). Emma is learning to use the scooter and we discovered a place to practice. We watched Bohemian Rapsody in the evening which was a super amazing film.

-   Sunday we walked the River loop and saw a kingfisher, some cormorants, ducklings, and plenty of people out boating. Great times! In the afternoon we had a call with my parents and arranged our first visit to see my Dad next weekend which we're all looking forward to.

-   **Running**: Two times last week, super lazy and tired and many such excuses.

-   **Reading**: I'm reading ["Running with the Buffaloes"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004HD49Q2/ref=pe_385721_48721101_TE_M1DP)
    by Chris Lear about a year spent with the University of Colorado Cross-country running team, so far it is excellent!

-   Exercise: Running twice times, plenty of walking the other days. 40 Vitality Points.
