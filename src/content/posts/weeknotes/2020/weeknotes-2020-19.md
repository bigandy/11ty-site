-   **Running**: Three times last week.

-   **Reading**: I finally finished reading ["Killing Commendatore"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38820047-killing-commendatore) by Haruki Murakami, phew a super long rambling but sadly poor book. Then I started reading ["The Pants of Perspective"](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35826103-the-pants-of-perspective) by Anna McNuff about a 3000km run the length of New Zealand.

-   Exercise: Running three times, biking once, PE with Joe Wicks or walk to the field other days. 40 Vitality Points.
