-   **Running**: A long run on Sunday [Ridgeway then back via Little Stoke and River](https://www.strava.com/activities/3145680620) which was a new route in the sunshine but cold wind. [Cholsey in the Cold Rain](https://www.strava.com/activities/3138816538) on Friday, [Wet Feet River Run](https://www.strava.com/activities/3136598327) on Thursday, and [Knackered River Run](https://www.strava.com/activities/3131238220) on Tuesday. 21.9 miles in total.

-   **Weekend**: We visited my parents over the weekend and my brother joined us on Saturday. Saturday we picket up my brother from the train station and then went to The Look Out. As the weather was awful we needed to go to the Science Center which was perfect for both children and adults with puzzles, learnings and a dumper truck for Arthur to go on. In the evening we had a nice meal and sat in front of the fire and played Perudo. On Sunday Rob took the train back to London and we walked round California Country Park and the kids played in the playground. In the evening I did a long run discovering a new route.

-   **Reading**: I finished reading ["Digital Minimalism"](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) by Cal Newport and I continued reading the second book of the Three Body problem Trilogy ["The Dark Forest"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest).

-   Exercise: Running Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday. Walked most other days. 40 Vitality Points.
