This week:

-   Made a nextjs dashboard page in my House Next Pi project with all the useful daily info for Arthur think Date/Time/Temp out/ Temp In/ Season etc.

-   Saturday we walked around the clumps and found 10s of Fairy Houses in the woods. Great fun but super cold in the wind.

-   Four runs. Distance of 21 miles.
