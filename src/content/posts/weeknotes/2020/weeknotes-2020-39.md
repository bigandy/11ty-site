I have had little energy to write here for a long time mainly because of the changing seasons, a hectic work schedule and a negativity that the world is going to shit again following an excellent summer. Not that surprising that the virus is back when schools, universities and work places are all going back to normal, and the colder days of Autumn bring us together more as we cannot be outside as much due to the weather.

But now I am back full of energy and excited that Autumn is here.

**This week**: This week I have been running twice, started and completed 50% of the Typescript course on Frontend Masters, been to the Harcourt Arboretum, thrown away a lot of stuff and organised the office and garage. I also discovered my DLSR again and took many photos of the family over the weekend.
