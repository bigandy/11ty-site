-   On Saturday we had a long long overdue fondue with friends morphed into a BBQ as it is summer and we needed to be outdoors to reduce the risk of catching _the virus_. As a result that was all we did on Saturday: eat cheese and meat and then fall into a deep cheese coma.

-   On Sunday I got up super early went for a run and then when I got back we went to Pangbourne where Marion and friends had a paddleboard booked for an hour. I entertained the kids. Then it was our turn and I pumped up the canoe and went for a trip along the river. Emma had different ideas and cried constantly so we had to go back with her so it was just Arthur and I on the boat. I really enjoy going on the river!

-   I ran four times this week:

    -   Mon: [River Consitution Hill Ridgeway](https://www.strava.com/activities/3720462823). Constitution Hill is a super steep hill and running up it leads into the countryside parallel to the Ridgeway.
    -   Wed: [Wet Parallel Lines Ridegway](https://www.strava.com/activities/3730304675) continuing along the route up Constitution Hill this was longer and hillier and wet as it was raining. Good route!
    -   Fri: [Fields North of Wallingford](https://www.strava.com/activities/3739737183). Always on the lookout for different routes this one was good except for the road running sections through town.
    -   Sun: [Bullcroft Q Castle Meadows](https://www.strava.com/activities/3749084643) I had to go running before we needed to go to Pangbourne. Tired running today.

-   **Reading**: I finished reading ["The Salt Path"](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-salt-path/raynor-winn/9781405937184) which is about a walk along the South West Coastal Path. Super enjoyable.

-   Exercise: Running four times. Canoeing on the Thames.
