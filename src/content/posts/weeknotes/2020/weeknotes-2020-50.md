This week:

-   I finished the [Client-side GraphQL Course on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/client-graphql-react/) which was pretty interesting. I then started the [Advanced GraphQL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-graphql-v2/) course also by the amazing [Scott Moss](https://twitter.com/scotups).

-   I ran 4 times this week. It has been raining a lot so there's a ton of mud on the most interesting routes. I'm tired at the end of this week.

-   Turned off the Hasura integration as I was going tracking way too often and it would have started to cost me. Next I will look at replacing it with SQLite.

-   Put up more Christmas decorations and lights, went to see the epic Cholsey Lights (there's a whole street that go to 11 on the lights, for Charity). Just the Neopixels to go. Working in Codepen to see what could be some great patterns.

-   Have been watching some of the Cyclocross on Eurosport. Basically mountain biking on a road bike, for an hour over laps of a course in Belgium or Holland. Lots of mud, lots of excitement!
