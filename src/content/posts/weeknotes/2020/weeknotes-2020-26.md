-   Last week at work coinciding with the heatwave we had our first ever design sprint. It was epic and tiring and rewarding and used something we've not done before (creating a Slack App) and meant that we were most of the week online in front of a webcam, sharing our vs code with team mates and generally having a great time.

*   **Reading**: I finished reading ["Running with the Buffaloes"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004HD49Q2/ref=pe_385721_48721101_TE_M1DP) which was really good and gave an excellent insight into University cross-country running and training.

*   Exercise: Running twice and kayaking once in our new inflatable canoe.
