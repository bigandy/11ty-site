This week:

-   Friday to Sunday the kids were with my parents and this allowed us our first child-free time since pre-covid times.
-   We went on two epic walks through the beautiful countryside around us, ate delicious and super smelly cheeses, watched films, read books and drank wine. It was great!
-   On Sunday I made a G&T cake for Marion's birthday but it was hopelessly sunken and uncooked in the middle. The edges were well cooked and delicious. Next time more time in the oven!
-   I ran twice last week.
-   We entered the second national lockdown but it seems a lot noisier than last time. People still drive to work, to drop off their children at school, drive to exercise. We can still go to the supermarket or take-away coffee shop for supplies.
