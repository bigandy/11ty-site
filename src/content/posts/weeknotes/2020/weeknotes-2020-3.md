-   From Monday until Thursday I was in Oxford with my Venture Harbour work colleagues for our Winter Retreat. As well as

-   Our friends Marielle, John, and Alejandro came round our house for dinner on Saturday and stayed over and we went for a really great pub walk on Sunday. The weather was cold, but with crystal blue skies and sunshine, and the kids loved jumping in icy puddles.

-   This week I ran four times including three times in Oxford - of which two were with my colleagues - and the final run was on Sunday afternoon in the fading light.

-   I signed up for [Maverick Dark Oxfordshire](http://www.maverick-race.com/races/thedarkoxfordshire2019) on the 8th of February which is a 15km cross-country trail run in the dark woods around Henley. I'm really looking forward to it as I love running in the dark, and Maverick events are always amazing.

-   Exercise: Running Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday. Walking most days. 40 Vitality Points!
