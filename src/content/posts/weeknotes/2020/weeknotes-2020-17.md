-   **Running**: Started running more often. Emma wakes up super early so I go at ~0615 on Mon, Wed and Fri. Fitness not really there but good to go out and have some _me_ time.

-   **Weather**: was superb most of last week and continued to explore the fields around with the kids and blow lots of Dandelion seeds.

-   **Reading**: I continued reading ["Killing Commendatore"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38820047-killing-commendatore) by Haruki Murakami.

-   Exercise: Running three times, biking once, PE with Joe Wicks or walk to the field other days. 40 Vitality Points.
