## Goodbye Digital Ocean.

I finally moved away from Digital Ocean. For about 10 years I have been using them because I had an array of WordPress projects and I was also interested in having a server that I could tinker with and change settings and get things like PHP 7, and http/2 running on it before they were 'cool'.

But that time has ended and I am now hosting all my sites on Netlify. This morning I converted the final two sites away from WordPress - one to Nextjs and the other to purely static HTML (using a WordPress plugin called WP2Static which created a static HTML file for each WordPress page, and saved all the assets to a zip file) keeping the code on Github. The nextjs site is a bit more involved but I am learning more about that as I go on, creating Gallery and Lightbox components.

-   **Running**: Three times last week. Have started to run faster which is good. Now I need to mix in some longer runs, runs with intervals or Fartlek.

-   **Reading**: I finished reading ["Running with the Kenyans"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0077ROL40/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Adharanand Finn and started reading ["Endure"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Endure-Curiously-Elastic-Limits-Performance-ebook/dp/B074S3863Q/) by Alex Hutchinson.

-   Exercise: Running three times, biking once, PE with Joe Wicks or walk to the field other days. 40 Vitality Points.
