This week:

-   I had a lazy post-birthday cake eating week where I didn't go running and wallowed in the darkness of the coming winter.
-   I started reading ["The Great Railway Bazaar"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Railway-Bazaar-Through-Classics/dp/0141189142) by Paul Theroux.
-   I enjoyed watching some of the [Vuelta a Espana](https://www.lavuelta.es/en/) on Eurosport. Hugh Carthy and Mike Woods are my heroes because they are riding for EF Pro Cycling ("my" team) and they won stages.
-   I'm still getting used to the clocks going back. But taking vitamins (and chocolate!) to help with this!
-   Had a small family gathering to celebrate my 40th birthday.
-   The government announced the second lockdown will start on Thursday.
