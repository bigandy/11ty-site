-   **This week was**: Supposed to be our holiday where we would go to Norfolk by the seaside and swim in the sea and relax. But the Lockdown had other ideas and we had the week off work and stayed at home and had superb weather, went for bike rides and played in the garden and put up the tent and got out the paddling pool. Several Zoom calls with family. I cut Arthur and my hair with the clippers. The weather was exceptionally warm and sunny. We watched films on TV and the kids drew pictures and so forth.

I ran once (a really hot 7 miler) and went for a bike ride almost every day. Either I or Marion would pull Emma in her trailer aka chariot and Arthur would ride as fast as he can. We need a new bike for him with gears as he's really good at cycling.

-   **Reading**: I received the next book in our book subscription (with the local book shop) ["Outside Looking In"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39854442-outside-looking-in) by TC Boyle. Exciting and a real page turner. I also continued reading ["Killing Commendatore"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38820047-killing-commendatore) by Haruki Murakami.

-   Exercise: Running once, biking every day. 40 Vitality Points.
