-   Emma has a place in a different nursery that has opened near my place of work (as her current normal nursery is still shut) which means that we finally have a few days a week where both kids are being looked after so we can get a breather and the kids can have some fun with their friends.

-   **Running**: Three times last week. I found a new route which is pretty hilly so that's a good one to do every week.

-   **Reading**: I'm really loving reading ["Running with the Buffaloes"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004HD49Q2/ref=pe_385721_48721101_TE_M1DP) and also the 100th edition of Eye Magazine dropped through the postbox which I am slowly working my way through.

-   Exercise: Running three times, plenty of walking the other days. 40 Vitality Points.
