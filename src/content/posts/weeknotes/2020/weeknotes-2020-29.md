-   On Saturday we met up with my parents, brother and his partner in a park in Richmond and had a great afternoon playing games, eating delicious food and even an ice cream!

*   I ran four times this week:

    -   Mon: [Field Cholsey Vets](https://www.strava.com/activities/3754543560). Legs tight, capout today.
    -   Wed: [Field River and down Consititution Hill](https://www.strava.com/activities/3764560883) All out sections. Tried for 1 mile at 5k pace and so difficult to breathe I need to do more of this to get faster! Want to go under 20mins for 5k sometime this year.
    -   Fri: [Shillingford River Cox's Lane](https://www.strava.com/activities/3774072418). Started off with my Shillingford 10k route, but then carried on as feeling good. 9 miles. Dog didn't like my t-shirt so I had to stop to let it past!
    -   Sun: [Castle Crowmarsh River in the Rain](https://www.strava.com/activities/3783638365) final one for the week, really soaked at the end and nothing I like more than running in the rain!

*   **Reading**: I demolished ["Running up that Hill"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0744VLFCW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Vassos Alexander which is about his journey from marathons to ultra-marathons including the Spartathlon (153 miles in less than 36 hours!) that ties the book together. Incredible!

*   Exercise: Running four times.
