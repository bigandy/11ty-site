Here's what I got up to over the last week:

-   I have applied for and been accepted for Voluntary Redundancy which is sad but also good because I get to take some time off before I start my next job.

-   Went for two bike rides this week. On Tueday with [Malc and George did Grimms Ditch](https://www.strava.com/activities/8600873820) and on Sunday I did [Blewbury - Ridgeway Solo](https://www.strava.com/activities/8625751505). On Wednesday I did a Zwift session [Zwift - Over Under's 4x 4min in Makuri Islands](https://www.strava.com/activities/8604277178).

-   On Saturday it was Arthur's birthday and he had friends over and we did a treasure hunt game in the local Paddocks field, then pass the parcel, tug of war, homemade pizza, smores over a fire pit were all super fun.

-   On Sunday I did looked after Emma did the bike ride and then went to the park with the kids and played basketball, then watched half of "Sing" and the highlights of the days cycling (final stage of the UAE Tour and Kuurne Brussels Kuurne)
