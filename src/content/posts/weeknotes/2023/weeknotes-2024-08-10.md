Having lived in Grenoble, France for almost two months now I thought that it would be a perfect time to write down what I am missing or not missing about living here compared to living in Wallingford, UK.

## Missing

-   ability to communicate with anyone with ease without thinking about it
-   bike rides with friends
-   Waitrose and comfort food
-   having a warm house with heating and insulation
-   TV

## Not Missing

-   Amazon / buy anything at any time for not very much consumerism
-   the food
-   the weather (although it is raining heavily today and autumn is in full swing so might change my mind!)
-   being on a housing estate so close to other houses (in UK) where it always felt like I was being overlooked or overheard by neighbours
-   TV

## Loving

-   Mountains: living in the Alps we are just a short bike or car ride from the mountains and from our house we can view

-   Bread: we have an excellent bakery just around the corner.

## Hating

-   Summertime mosquitos. Actually its early October and there are still the odd one or two.
-   Lack of instant
