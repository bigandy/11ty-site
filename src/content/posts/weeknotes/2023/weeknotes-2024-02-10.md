Here's what I got up to last week:

-   Made my first solo purchase at the Boulangerie. Wanted: 1 baguette and a pain au chocolat. Received: 4 pain au chocolates and a crappy baguette. Result! Learning French and also the terminology of bread and also pronunciation all are important. These steps allow the confidence to grow and more complex purchases to be made.

-   Visited by my brother and his family. Our first guests in Grenoble!
-   Over the weekend with Rob, Megan and Bobby we went up Bastille either by the Eggs or by foot. We discovered a new higher viewing platform that after two months of living in Grenoble we had not discovered. The day was fantastic and we could see Mont Blanc.
-   Last week was Marion's first week at work so a lot of adjusting is going on at the moment.

-   I signed up for a French course at the Alliance Francaise. It will start in a few weeks time.
