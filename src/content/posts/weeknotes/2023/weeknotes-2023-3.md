- Worked from the co-work space in Milton Park on Wednesday
- Met colleagues in Bicester on Thursday and received some worrying news
- Ran for the first time this year on Saturday: through flooded river paths then up the hill and back: [2ft deep River and Ridgeway Run](https://www.strava.com/activities/8389812858)
