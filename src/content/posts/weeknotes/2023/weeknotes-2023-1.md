Wishing you a Happy and Healthy New Year!

Here's what I got up to over the last couple of weeks:
- put up curtains and picture frames and a new rug in the lounge just in time for family to stay at Christmas
- Christmas with family where my Mum, Dad and Brother were ill but great times and food was had
- playing and walking and entertaining the kids
- fun times round friends house with board games and delicious food and drink
- one Cheese Shed bike ride with Alistair, G and Richard
- one Spire and Spoke bike ride with Alistair and G (with added aeropress and sticky super hill)
- watching many CX races on the TV (pretty exciting with the big three on the mens side in action - Pidcock, Van der Poel, Wout Van Aert)
- Christmas wine tasting with friends at Grape Minds
