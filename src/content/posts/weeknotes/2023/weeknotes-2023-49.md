Here's what I got up to last week:

-   Created a [Raycast Extension](https://github.com/bigandy/raycast-extensions/tree/main/create-new-weeknote) to assist the creation of new weeknotes. I used it to create this weeknote. I love [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/).
-   Watched a bit of the Chelsea versus Man Utd football
-   Zwifted a lot this week. [Mon](https://www.strava.com/activities/10328793578), [Tue](https://www.strava.com/activities/10334231146), [Thurs](https://www.strava.com/activities/10342843856), [Saturday](https://www.strava.com/activities/10353985256). Attempting to banish the winter blues by doing a bit more exercise.
-   Was ill on Friday. There was a one day gap between the previous cold and this one. Damn the winter season for colds and illnesses!
-   Went for a horrendously muddy and wet mountain bike ride on [Sunday with Alistair to the Cheese Shed](https://www.strava.com/activities/10359579016).
-   Watched ["Ghosted"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15326988/) and then ["Violent Night"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12003946/) over the weekend. Not a great selection of masterpiece films but they were both entertaining.
-   Reading ["Every Man for Himself and God Against All"](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/19/every-man-for-himself-and-god-against-all-by-werner-herzog-review-magical-thinking) by Werner Herzog. A great book so far.
-   Have been doing some of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) this year again. Some are straightforward and I can crack them, some more time consuming and I can crack them. Now I feel that I have given it a good go and get on with my life. There is not enough time for this puzzle with a family, a job and the exercise I want to be doing. Something has to give and it is the AOC that I am willing to stop. Good fun though!
