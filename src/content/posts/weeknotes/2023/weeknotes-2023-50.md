Here's what I got up to last week:

-   Went to Cholsey to see the epic Christmas Lights Street (Ilges Lane, Cholsey) with the children on Monday evening.
-   Zwifting on [Mon](https://www.strava.com/activities/10363045856), [Tue](https://www.strava.com/activities/10367335078) and [Thursday](https://www.strava.com/activities/10380902720).
-   Office Party in London on Tuesday.
-   [Christmas Bike ride to Phantom Brewery Tap Room in Reading with G](https://www.strava.com/activities/10386358979) on Friday
-   Saturday with my parents we did the [Watercress Line Christmas Lights Extravaganza](https://watercressline.co.uk/special-days/steam-illuminations/)
-   Sunday we had mulled wine and Christmas snacks round friends house.
-   Watched ["The Family Plan"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16431870/) which was entertaining but rather shit at the same time.
-   Watched the men's [X20 Trofee Herentals Cyclocross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkIYMYeKOkQ) from Saturday which Mathieu van der Poel attacked from the gun and was never seen again. Epic! Really looking forward to the [Christmas CX races (10 days of almost constant CX racing) with the Big Three](https://bigandy-astro.netlify.app/blog/big-three-cx-2023-24/).
-   Almost finished "Every Man for Himself and God Against All".
