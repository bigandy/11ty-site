Here's what I got up to over the last week:
- Did three Zwift rides - starting to get into it although the weather has been really cold so Zwifting in the garage needs plenty of clothing layers!
- Marion was in Belgium with her friend from Thu to Sun so I had the kids. We did lots of cool stuff including: walk with my parents in the frozen lands of Basildon Park; Bike riding in Faringdon with friends and then to an American Diner for lunch on; swimming on Friday evening.
- Ordered new glasses at the opticians.
- Watched the Docu-series about Spotify on Netflix.
- Watched the World Cup Cyclo Cross in Benidorm, Spain on GCN+ - wow both races were epic!
- Continued listening to Austin Kleon's "The Steal Like an Artist Audio Trilogy" on Audible. A lot of real good nuggets in there!
- Started reading "Future Sex" by Emily Witt
- Did some coding
