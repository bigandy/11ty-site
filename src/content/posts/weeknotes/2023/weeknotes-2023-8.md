Here's what I got up to over the last week:

-   Final pottery class. This week we were glazing the pottery that we created in the first 5 weeks. It'll be another 3 weeks until we see the final results.

-   Bike Ride to the [Black Horse with George](https://www.strava.com/activities/8562275938). Was a short and fast ride but the pub and beer were amazing. One Zwift session: [Zwift - The Gorby in Yorkshire](https://www.strava.com/activities/8553965548)

-   Long (Fri-Sun) weekend in London visiting my brother and his family. We went to Covent Garden, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, River Cruise, DLR, Bus and a tube, and a chilled out Swim on Sunday. Great fun but super tired by the end of the weekend.

-   Started to read "How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big" by Scott Adams. Finished listening to "The Steal Like an Artist Audio Trilogy" by Austin Kleon

-   Container Queries were released in Firefox so now they're in [all major browsers](https://web.dev/cq-stable/). This is super exciting as they are really an amazing CSS feature.
