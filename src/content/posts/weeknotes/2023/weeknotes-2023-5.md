Here's what I got up to over the last week:

-   Went running twice: once with Marion on Thursday lunchtime and on Monday lunchtime solo
-   Two times on Zwift: rode up a seriously steep (with sections of 15%) mountain near Innsbruck, and a solo ride ride (i.e. not a training ride, just one where you can explore!).
-   Had friends over for Sunday afternoon
-   Watched lots of evening cycling - currently they're racing in Argentina in the Tour de San Juan, plus racing in Mallorca, plus a race in Australia. Amazing time of the year and finally an end to the road cycling drought since the end of last season!
-   Watched the mens CX World Cup - a Matthiew van der Poel masterclass in Besan√ßon, France [see this video short on Twitter](https://twitter.com/UCIcyclocrossWC/status/1620316072854360065)
-   Converted my [Astro site](https://bigandy-astro.netlify.app/) to Astro v2 including the excellent new collections api. Thinking of moving this site over to Astro.
-   Finished reading ["Future Sex" by Emily Witt](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/01/future-sex-a-new-kind-of-free-love-emily-witt-review-orgasmic-meditation-burning-man-polyamory). Was ok.
-   Started reading ["Solo" by Jenny Tough](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SOLO-running-across-mountains-taught/dp/178325470X)
