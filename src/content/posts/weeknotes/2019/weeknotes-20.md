Since last time I have:

-   Been on holiday with Marion and the kids to Croatia for a couple of weeks of sun, relaxing, swimming and sight-seeing.
-   Completed [Maverick Tribe 24k trail running event](https://www.strava.com/activities/2395541069) (the furthest yet that I have run!) - it was hot and very hilly. Now on the lookout for the next event to train and run in.
-   Celebrated Emma turning 1 and continues to try to walk, can climb the stairs and move very quickly. Also she has a lack of fear so we have to be super vigilant what she tries to climb / walk with.
