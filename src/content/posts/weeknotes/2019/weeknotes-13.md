## Exercise

-   Have started using the rowing machine at the gym, and also doing some lat pulldowns.
-   Keeping at 3x a week always consisting of run/cycle/elliptical.
-   Running on the weekend usually Sunday.

## Bread making course

On Saturday I did a [bread making course at Cornfield Bakery](https://cornfieldbakery.com/bread-making-courses.html) - my birthday present from Marion - and it was incredible. We made sourdough and fresh yeast-derived bread, plus our teacher - Joe - made some sweet breads (Chelsea Buns, Brioche, Chocolate/PnB swirl) to take home as well.

I want to keep the sourdough bread making going so will make some every weekend.
