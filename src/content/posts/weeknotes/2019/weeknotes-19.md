We have finally moved house!

-   Last week was super stressful and tiring
-   Marion went back to work
-   Emma started nursery and didn't sleep well all week
-   We moved house on Friday to Wallingford from Cholsey finally completing our move from Didcot (we had to rent while our new house was being built).
