-   Today is the Sunday between Christmas and NYE and we staying with Marion's parents. Marion’s brother Aurele his wife Marie Atrid and their daughter Julia are here too - in the west of France near La Rochelle. Outside it is freezing cold so we are inside in front of the fire and a Disney film.

-   Marion and I went together for two runs this week!

-   I signed up for a year of Strava Summit and with this I am able to set weekly targets - and other things like sharing my realtime location with others - and this first week I have set a goal of 20 miles and I went running 4 times with a total of 22.2 miles including an 8.3 mile run on Monday.

-   I have eaten and drunk and been on plenty of walks this last week. Tis Christmas after all!

-   Père Noël was kind with tasty French chocolates, a beer subscription, delicious Belgian beer and French cheese and saucisson, a jumper (I get all my tops in France!) and Yatzee.

-   I’m writing this from my iPad on iA Writer then copying it across to Github.com in my repo. I want to write more in the next 12 months so I think this could be a good way of helping me do this.

-   Exercise: Running Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Walking every day. 40 Vitality Points!
