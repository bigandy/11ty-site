-   This (Saturday) morning we all took ourselves to the Ridgeway and walked along breathing the cold humid (but fresh!) air and getting some views of the distant lands.
-   so much rain has fallen, the river is so swollen and running along it last night was too difficult. I had to stop and wade through ankle deep stretches. Also I could use a decent running light as the beam of light from my phone's torch is too poor to run with. [Here's the run](https://www.strava.com/activities/2866812104).
-   Work has been pretty hectic lately, not on Serene this sprint but on another older project.
-   I re-started running going out before the crack of dawn on Thursday morning in the cold and super dark. [Here's the run](https://www.strava.com/activities/2863694614).
-   With work people we went to the [Thirsty Meeples](https://thirstymeeples.co.uk/) board games cafe to celebrate the release of Serene and an excellent few months at work.
-   It was Marion's birthday last week and we went to The Copa Club in Streatley. I made Marion a Gin and Tonic birthday cake.
