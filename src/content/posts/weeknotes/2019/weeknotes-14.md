-   Arthur had his fourth birthday and with 3 other equally aged friends had a joint birthday party with pirate ship, push cars, pass the parcel amongst other fun things. My parents, brother and his g/f stayed over for the weekend and it was great to catch up.
-   Emma is getting more and more mobile so have to keep an eye on her at all times because she will be most likely trying to eat a power cable or tip over a plant pot if you are not careful.
-   New house is getting closer to completion, we were shown around before the plaster had been laid.
-   Fitness: gym 3 times and two family walks.
