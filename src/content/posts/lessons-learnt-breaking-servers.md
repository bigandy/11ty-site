Last week I decided to upgrade the version of nginx that I'm using to run this site. Without taking any backups. On a Thursday evening when I was going to be busy for the entire weekend. What could possibly go wrong? Well, as it turns out, everything! All my sites also were offline, and it took me many hours to call decide that I wasn't going to be able to fix it and then to call it quits. I fired up a new instance on Digital Ocean with my files and databases backed up. Those hours were very frustrating and stressful. I think I learned a bit more about servers so that next time I will be able to do it properly. That next time is not going to be for a good few weeks! Now luckily I am now back online, on a new server (fortunately I back up everything on git, and could log in to grab the file uploads and take a Database dump).
