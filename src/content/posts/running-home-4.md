Coughing hard from tonight's run, the first of the week, but glad I did go running as I took the weekend off and didn't have the energy or motivation to run yesterday. I have been suffering since Friday with a cold which is probably from the forced training effort. Less than 4 weeks to go until the Reading Half-Marathon now.
