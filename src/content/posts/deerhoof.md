listening to deerhoof and liking it much! I've gone through a faze of downloading every band that I hear is good (in nme, in the newspapers, on the radio online and so on!!!) and then have not really had the time to listen to much of it (other than the stuff that I put on my mp3 player). There is much much much more than I can ever listen to but I am doing my very best this evening to listen to a good % of it :) So far I've listened to the Noisettes' "What's the Time Mr Wolf" (yup, great stuff!) and now I'm onto Deerhoof's myspace collection. [deerhoof (myspace)](http://myspace.com/deerhoof). After the Klaxons gig I had half an hour to kill before the train arrived so I got NME. Used to read it every week, my god how has it changed. Where it used to be full of long insightful articles about the latest new music, now it is full of cranky short (50 word max) pieces about the cool bands. What a waste of paper. But what else is there for decent coverage, something decent to read? There is [Plan B](http://www.planbmag.com) (arty, wordy and a free cd with every issue!) and [drowned in sound](http://drownedinsound.com/) (yes this site looks real good actually!) and [wire](http://www.thewire.co.uk/) (if you like bands that'll never get heard by anyone else). Went to Reading to see "Notes on a Scandal" this morning. Really excellent film. Dench and Blanchett deliver mesmerising acting masterclasses and its an intriguing story. Picked up a new pair of black converse boots and then hotfooted back home to catch the first rugger game. Sooo dull and boring that went to sleep and missed France annihilate Italy 39-3. But I did see England return to their World Cup winning form with a resurgant Jonny Wilkinson scorring 27 perfect points, Jason Robinson scorring a try and Scotland being destroyed 42-20. Days like these can never come often enough.
