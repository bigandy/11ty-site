sunny outside and this is a quick short post! You can download for free the new [blur](http://www.blur.co.uk/ 'blur website') song which they recorded for yesterday's [independent record shop day](http://www.recordstoreday.com/Home 'indepedent record shop day') as a limited edition 1000-copy single sided 7" vinyl. At midnight they released it for free via their website as mp3 (5Mb) and un-compressed wav (34 Mb but much better quality!). Yesterday went to Oxford and apparently it was also Oxford Folk Festival and there were hundreds of morris dancers on the streets. Otherwise we went to the covered market for a Ben's Cookie and then to the grass to sit down and enjoy the cloudless skies and blue hot sunshine.
