Well it's been a couple of weeks into 2010 and lots of snow has fallen and almost melted again. Christmas and New Year were great and lots of great food and superb company! I've not been running because of the snow on the ground and because of different illnesses. But soon all the snow will be gone and I will be better! On Wednesday I took my CIW Foundations exam and passed with 91%! So that means that I am a "CIW Associate" and can move onto the 4th exam: CIW Site Designer. Now I have a bit of spare time before the books for this course arrive I will have time to sleep and then some time to work on my website so that I can say yes that's me!
