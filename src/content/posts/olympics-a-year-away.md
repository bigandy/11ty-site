Today marks start ofÂ  one-year count-down to the 2012 London Olympics. Already there is much in the press and warm-up events that are here to help prepare for next summer. One event that I am really interested in is the Olympic Cycling [Road Race warm-up](http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/529520/stars-line-up-for-olympic-road-race-test-event.html) to be held on the 14th of August. The event includes many riders from this years Tour de France, including sprinters Mark Cavendish and Tom Boonen.
