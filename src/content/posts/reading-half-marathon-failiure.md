This year I didn't run the Reading Half-Marathon. I'd signed up for it on the 30th of August last year and I totally was committed to doing it, right until the beginning of February when I changed jobs. While I was at HeathWallace there was an active running club that went out every Wednesday evening after work for 7+ miles and since being at Electric Studio there is none. But this is a **big excuse** which hides the fact that I have been lazy and not been running for 2 months. In the new job I have magnificent countryside to go running in, and even has shower so I can go running at lunchtime. Starting this lunchtime I will start running again. Just because running for me is a way of getting rid of the stresses of life (work, commuting, Winter) and good way of keeping fit.
