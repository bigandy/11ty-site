This incredibly accurate image shows what I am feeling like this Monday morning. Tired achy, grumpy. (cheers to [my Bro](http://rob-hudson.com 'rob hudson') for the link) In other news I bought a new road bike, a [Bianchi Via Nirone 7 Sora, 2011](http://www.bianchi.com/Uk/Bikes/Bikes_Detail.aspx?ProductIDMaster=51346 'my new bianchi bike'), and went cycling with Marion in the countryside to the North of Reading. Now I ache a lot due to my lack of fitness and the uncomfortableness of a road bike compared to the mountain bike I usually ride. I spent the rest of the weekend watching the final two stages of this years Tour de France.
