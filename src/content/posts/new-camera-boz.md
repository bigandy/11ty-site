Running: Tuesday: "Stables" solo in the hard blast wind. Wednesday: "Extended Long Toll" effectively solo (only 3 of us: B + E took it slower than me), in the rain (drizzle). Legs felt heavy, especially thighs. Went to cinema with Marion and Marielle last night, we watched "Flags of our Fathers". Quite liked, the second of the diptych "Letters from Iwo Jima" is on Thurs so will be good to compare the representations of the US and Japanese armies, the way their homelands viewed the battle. After dunking my old digital camera in a pint of cider at The Maccabees gig in Feb I finally got my arse into gear and ordered a replacement. Today it arrived at work and I very am happy! It's a Canon Ixus 70 (replacement of the Ixus 55 which I drowned, but 7 mp instead of 5). Can use the old batteries, charger, memory cards and so on... It's great. Now I need subjects to point my foto skills at. Roll up, roll up!!!
