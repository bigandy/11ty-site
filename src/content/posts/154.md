Yes new camera at last arrived at work in time for the blue skies and sunshine! It's a [Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX500](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0803/08031802panasonicfx500.asp). 10Mpix; 5x optical zoom; touch-screen control. Looking and feeling very tasty! Yes it's almost the weeeeekend and next week we are off to Turkey!!! Have you heard the new song by Weezer ["Pork and Beans"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muP9eH2p2PI 'vid from youtube')? Doing the serious viral rounds, great music nice vid too.
