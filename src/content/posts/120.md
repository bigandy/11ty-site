**Friday!** thank fuck for that, Friday has finally arrived. I woke up this morning slightly hungover from last night, bah.Â  Yesterday I went running after work, a new route through Woodley inclusive of a nice hill to start with! Sunshine blazing and wind ripping into me I did the [Woodley 2.8miles](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=1808859) route in ~20mins (much quicker than I imagined) and then jumped into the shower and started cooking for the party. I made banana and apple crumble, then chocolate cookies, and M made quiche and dips and aperatifs. People arrived and we ate talked listened to music and catched up, ate some more and drunk more, then played Jungle Speed (crazy French game). Lots of newbies so not as fast but really funny. Going home now it's Friday!!!
