I've deleted my facebook account. I feel amazing. Here's why. For many years I have had a Facebook account but have hardly ever used it. Sometimes I shared pictures, or messages, sometimes just to keep up with the news of people that I used to go to school and university, or out of touch friends. But what for? To look over the shoulder or through the window of those you used to know, of people from your past. What is the point of this? Recently we moved house and the estate has its own Facebook group, and I would often spend time reading the (mostly idiotic) messages left there; people complaining and getting wound up over the smallest things. What a waste of time it all is. Isn't time better spent learning and doing rather than comparing your life to that of others? So. Slowly the process began. Removing people from my Facebook (unfriending them), people that I went to school with, people that I never really cared about in the first place. Then the Facebook groups, then Facebook itself. Download all your history (and uploaded photos). Then press the blue button to delete Facebook (takes 14 days). I feel free, more free than I did last week. **Update: (22.12.2014)** I have just signed up to Facebook again, this time for reasons that I can keep in contact with Family with baby photos after Marion has given birth. I will block it at work so it won't be a distraction.
