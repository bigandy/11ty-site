Last night with the guys from work I went to the third edition of Breaking Borders (bi-monthly web meetup at Reading University). Speakers were Seb Lee-Delisle (lasers!) and Adam Onishi (Nurturing the Roots). To add even further excellence I won a limited edition Lunar Trails print (pictured above, credit: [seb](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebleedelisle)) from [Seb Lee-Delisle](http://seb.ly/) which will look superb in my new office.
