Tomorrow afternoon we'll be taking the airplane to Madrid to see our good friends Cesar and Inma in their new home for the first time since they moved there last year. I can't wait to go back to Madrid after briefly stopping there in 2005 on my epic round Europe train trip. I slept in Madrid station on the street because I arrived at midnight and there was no accomodation in the city or any way of getting there. After my night on the tarmac I found that I'd been bitten 30 times on my back, tummy and legs by insects and spent the next week itching and in agony, but that's another story. So you can imagine that I am looking forward to a return trip to see what actually Madrid has to offer!
