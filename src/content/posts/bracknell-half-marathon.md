Yah, wow, mesmerising, aching, happy. On Sunday I raced in the Bracknell Half-Marathon and beat my personal best by 7:08 in a fantastic time of 1:34:54. The first 10miles I took at a steady pace monitoring my time every 3 miles using my bike computer's clock(note to self :buy decent running watch!). Marion was supporting me on her bike so it was a great surprise everytime I saw her beautiful face, and more motivation for me to get to the finish asap! The course was through the pavements and tracks of bracknell and had a few hills, the course was well marshalled and very well supported throughout. After starting out in murky humid sunshine the run was pleasant and warm until the rain began falling at mile 11 and t-storm and heavy rain accompanied me through miles 12 to the finish... Huzzah! Now I feel great.
