Running: Long Toll (btw: what is the difference between this and "extended long toll"?) faster than I'd planned. Steve's fault. He was doing a fartlek session which I didn't know at the time so I dug really deep and caught him up. Shudda gone slower but a challenge is a challenge right;) 5 (?) miles in 37 mins.
