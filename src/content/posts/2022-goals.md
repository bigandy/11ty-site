# This Year

## Fitness

-   One mountain bike ride per week.
-   Drink more water and eat healthier
-   Go back to the gym again when Covid has again receeded to acceptable levels (what does this even mean??)
-   I'd love to loose the Christmas and Covid weight gain so I want to start eating healthier again. I think that eating bread is a big reason I find it difficult to loose weight so changing my diet to include less bread would be a good starting point.

## Reading

-   Continue to read a lot of different types of books. I'm keeping track of the books that [I have read / am reading here](https://strong-star-7e7.notion.site/6519d60126584ce88283167647f09503?v=9fefe33c56e14806b3170531fd776db4)

## Learning

-   This is the year when I want to create my first React Native app
-   Continue to keep up with learning the new CSS and JavaScript and other web-development technologies that are continuing to evolve. I love learning and I want to continue to build demos and Codepens, use my demo section on this site to showcase some cool new stuff that is being introduced cross-browser.
-   Writing is always something that I want to "do". Having this site allows my to have somewhere to practice. If I combine the practice with the learning I can then share this knowledge and become a better writer in the process.
-   I will continue to learn French using the Duolingo app on my Phone.

## Writing

-   I want to write more often on this site and also to learn how to write better so that I build my personal brand.
-   I enjoy keeping in touch with friends but that has taken a back foot since kids so I want to do that more often.
