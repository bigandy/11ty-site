I've been a keen user of [google inbox](https://inbox.google.com) for over a month and here are my initial thoughts. I love it! Plus points:

-   ability to tick all of the emails and threads that you have read or actioned and not see them on the main page
-   set up to-dos.
-   the design is really something special, it focuses you on the task in hand and looks stunning too.
-   I love that you can pin emails,
-   delay reading emails until later (e.g. tomorrow, next week, or some specified time).
-   automatic categorisation of emails into groups such as "Social" or "Purchases" or "Travel",
-   delay reading these categories until a specified time each week or day.

Minus points:

-   Have to click on chat icon to then open new chats could this have been incorporated into the plus icon at the bottom right?
-   Difficult to see whether other chat people are online or not (unless they are using Inbox already)
