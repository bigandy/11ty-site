Trying to work on my plugin this evening has been frustrating because I keep on getting an error that says :

> The plugin generated 303 characters of unexpected output during activation. If you notice â€œheaders already sentâ€ messages, problems with syndication feeds or other issues, try deactivating or removing this plugin.

And I have been banging my head against a wall trying to fix this issue. Not really a big problem in that the plugin works as intended but if a wordpress user sees this error more than likely they will panic, deactivate and delete the plugin and run for the hills. How to solve it?
