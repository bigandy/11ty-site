[Fuji Rock 2007](http://www.smash-uk.com/frf07/) (pre-reg from Friday, costs Â¥32,800, till Feb 18th). An enormous dump of snow is now slowly melting. Woke up this am to find 10cm of it. Made me happy, cos I love snow wonderful snow. England are the worst team in the world. We suck. Cannot play for shit. But we knew that. Where is the passion, where is the class, where is the will to fight to win, the fight to score goals???
