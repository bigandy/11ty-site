My first run of the season (not including running in NYC) was tonight and it was good to be outside and running! Only 2.17 miles in 15'28" (7.07min/mile pace) I was a small step on the long journey that is ahead of me until next March when I will be doing my third [Reading Half-Marathon](http://www.readinghalfmarathon.com/ 'reading half-marathon') on the 21th March 2010.
