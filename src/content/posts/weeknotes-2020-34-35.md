## Two weeks of Quarantine at my parents!

The ferry took us smoothly back across la Manche from Caen to Portsmouth and we all took a snooze in our cabin. Arriving in the UK we drove through the dark evening back to our home in Wallingford. finally, but not for long. A sleep and then back in the car - to my parents to Quarantine for 2 weeks.
