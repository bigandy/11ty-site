Last week I finished my first ever web job - creative developer at HeathWallace - and took the train north to New Adventures in Web Design in Nottingham. The conference was incredible, such a vast array of different talks ideas and information that I haven't even started to finish taking it all in. After returning South on Friday, a weekend in Winchester for a friend's birthday leads me to here, Tuesday, where I have the week off before I start my new job - front-end WordPress developer at Electric Studio. I have been learning how to use my brand new 15" MacBook Pro Retina - first time I have ever owned (or really used) a Mac and its taking a lot of adjusting to get used to things after spending my entire computer life on a PC. Everything is **different** and not necessarily in a good way. To write this post, and make a few updates to my site, I have gone back to the PC (with mini extremely low resolution 10 year old monitor). When I start my new job I will be forced to use the Mac every day so will soon get up to speed with everything that I have not learnt so far. Snow has now gone, rain in its place. I think I will now get my coat and shoes on and take a walk into town and get some fresh air.
