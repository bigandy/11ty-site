Running: "Reverse Stables" quite quickly! Cooler than on Monday, with a bit of biting wind. I hate oilseed rape but there are many many fields around here where I have to run though/past. Sure it looks great: all bright yellow and energising. But the pollen/smell gets into my sinuses and gives me a fucking headache. Ran down the hill and along the road - realised was going really quick and had dropped Mike and others long ago. Took it easy on the hill and stepped it up a little on the route back to base. 5 miles in 30-35 mins.
