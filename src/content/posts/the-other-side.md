Running: tried another new route today:["The Other Side"](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=902231). Never run on the South side of the river so this is what I did: down the hill, along the river bank until Mapledurham lock, turn right and keep going until hit A329, turn right and follow A329 on pavement until Pangbourne, turn right and continue over bridge, then up up up the hill. I managed to keep going until I got back to Pangbourne (about 5 miles in) then had to stop running because I had bad stomach cramps and I would have exploded unless I stopped running. Walked the remaining distance arriving back at work just in time for a meeting.!. Distance: 7.25 miles. Time: 1hr 10mins. After work I walked along the river with Alejandro to Tilehurst and then went drinking with him and his flatmate Jo and got slaughtered. Yipeeee!!!
