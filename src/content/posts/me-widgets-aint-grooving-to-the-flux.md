Here is a quote:

What is up? Up before 8am on a Sunday morning but when the eyes open yer just have to get up, have a shower, then turn the computer on and type a Sunday morning blog post. Yeeeeeehahahahaha. ^-\_-^ Widgets. This is concerned with this blog's development so let your eyes glaze over if yer aren't a development nooger. The widgets are not working, i want to install a flickr gallery link and the widgets are the easiest (only?) way of doing this. Seems that the JS is not working, should be installed in the latest Wordpress update/upgrade but its not grooving yet.
