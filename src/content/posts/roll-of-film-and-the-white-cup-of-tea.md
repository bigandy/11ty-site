Good evening everyone. Back online blogging again after what seems like forever. Today I had my eyes tested and I didn't recieve my digital SLR (Nikon d80) in the post (hopefully it will arrive in time for my first photography lesson - which happens to be tomorrow night). Not wanting to splash out and pay big money on my first ever DSLR I had a good look around the internet and in photography magazines and decided that I wanted to get the Nikon d40, but after countless failed bids on eBay and not being able to find a decently priced model elsewhere I decided to go for the more expensive and higher-spec d80. Last week was really hectic. I finally decided that I needed less distraction and had to tell my brother that I couldn't work on his project which was tough for both of us: I wanted to do it and learn on the job, and he wanted to help me and get on of his projects moving faster. Anyway. More study time for me! Since deciding to take a photography evening course at the local university I have discovered many many excellent websites, photographers and ideas. Two of my favorite websites are [Chase Jarvis](http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/ "Chase Jarvis' Blog") and [Strobist](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2009/09/light-is-not-your-problem.html 'Strobist Post'). The course starts tomorrow evening and if my camera arrives I will start putting photos on this blog. Watch out!
