At the end of December I accepted an offer to become a front-end WordPress developer with [Electric Studio](http://www.electricstudio.co.uk/) a WordPress studio in Abingdon, Oxfordshire and I am really looking forward to it. The new position will focus on building responsive, highly optimised and mobile-first sites powered by WordPress. It will be my chance to learn a great deal - JavaScript, PHP, mobile and RWD - and a chance to be a professional (rather than working for friends - for free) WordPress developer, something that I have been looking for for a very long time!
