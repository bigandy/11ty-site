up at 7 on my day off. what the fuck? sunshine sprinkles through the open window to my left, and cat snoozes on the bed to my right, me: my eyes are just about unsprinkled of sleepy dust (after a toasty bath!) as I get prepped for a day in London. Yesterday after work went back to Marion's where she cooked something French (mouyonne quiche!), plus M&S cheescakes mmm, then we met Rebecca and went to see "Science of Sleep" at the uni cinema. Great film, saw it in London in Feb after missing out on it when it was at the Cambridge Film Festival (do I need to tell you all these minor details?), and haven't laughed soo much for ages. gosh, well not during a film, so. Intermixed with seriously fucked up french mind-thoughts there's a love story going on. Between Gael and Charlotte. Caught final train back after a jar and some cheesecake (chocolate!) with Rebecca at the pub. \[update: caught train to London, went to Covent Garden found Aussie Shop and bought stuff, found a couple of Tea shops including the Tea Place in Neale Street, and bought lotsa tea, to Stanfords to buy the GR20 guidebook. Met with cousin Fiona for lunch off Carnabie Street (fantastic Thai meal!), then walked to Marble Arch and slept on grass knackered. Caught train to Cheltenham to stay night with bro. Watched Sympathy for Mr Vengeance in evo altho I slept through most of it... hahaha!\]
