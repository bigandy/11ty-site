I've done it, signed up for Henley half-marathon. It was a choice of two different half-marathons on the very same day: Oxford (£31) and Henley (£21) of which I really wanted to do Oxford and Henley but the extra cost swung it to Henley. Our friend Christelle is also doing Henley, and I've cycled up the steep (very steep!) hill and have walked around the area so know a little of what it'll be like. Much pain and sufferance will be endured no doubt! This gives me something to get my arse into gear about as I have not run since June 5th (ouch, that's a long time ago!). So. There's a local running club: Didcot Runners, I can commute to work (2.8 miles), and explore for new running routes from our new house.
