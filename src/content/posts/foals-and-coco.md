Last night we went to see Foals at the Oxford Academy and was thoroughly impressed by the band. Very tight musically and some really good songs. I was however dissapointed that a lot of their songs sound very similar with the same beat/rhythm and this band are an excellent party band, if you want class then listen to another band. Stand out song was the superb Spanish Sahara. Before the gig looking for urgent nourishment walking along Cowley Road we discovered Coco.
