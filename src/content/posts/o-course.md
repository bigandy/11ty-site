sitting here in kidderminster on CompTIA A+ Essentials workshop just had first mock exam waiting for the others to finish so can have results. think I need a lot of revision and further work before can take the exam but will see. looking forward to drive home... looking forward to getting home. Update: I passed the mock with 77/100 (needed 70% to pass, will need 75% in real exam) and journey back went well.
