Back to running for 3 weeks now after a prolonged and intermittant winter and spring while I was commuting to and from Walton-on-Thames every working day. Now I cycle to work and can run in the lunchtime because there is a shower and some decent running routes. I have managed 2/3-times a week and every time so far I have tried a different route (6 different routes). I try to alternate between running along the canal (flat, less pollution) and road (more hilly, more cars). The longest route I did was 7.3 miles in 61mins along the canal. Life at work is ok, a bit repetitive for my liking but things can change. Also, people are a bit quiet but again this can change as we are a new team (3 new members in the last 3 weeks!). What we need is some socialising to break down the barriers! Have been watching Olympics and we (UK) are doing really well in the cycling! More potential golds today are in the Men's Madison (Wiggins and Cavendish) and Men's (Hoy and Kenny) and Woman's (Pendleton) Sprint. Have also watched a number of great films: The Bank Job, Hancock and Wanted, Roman Holiday, and The Dark Knight.
