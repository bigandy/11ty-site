The last couple of nights I have been working on implementing some grid techniques (horizontal and vertical alignment of content) and have [uploaded my first template](http://www.big-andy.co.uk/ideas/grid960.php). Now I realise its just a start and there's much more to learn but Im enjoying the process!
