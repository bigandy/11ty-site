Good Evening Folks, Sitting here in two jumpers a pair of gloves, scarf, hat and cup of hot tea it's not that spring-like anymore. Anyway I've been ill for the last few days and it's great to be able to get out of the house, go to work, that kind of thing. Even if it is dull repetitive boring pay-the-bills work. Anyway, I am listening to [Gilles Peterson's Guide to Istanbul](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00j8gjy/International_Radio_1_Istanbul_Turkey/ "Gilles' Guide to Istanbul") on my laptop waiting for the food shopping to be delivered. I'd like to recommend a website, if you like global music, called [Fly Global Music](http://www.flyglobalmusic.com/fly/index.html 'fly global music'). It's less than one week until the Reading Half-Marathon and my legs are exceptionally painful when I walk. I went to Lyon on the weekend and a day spent running round the city and then running up the massive hill that overlooks the city all have stretched my legs and caused me much pain for the last couple of days when I manage to walk around. Hopefully they're better for the race this weekend.
