# The Year that was 2021

I have seen a number of people's end of year reports and I thought that it would be good for me to start 2022 by writing one for myself.

2021 Was the the second year of the global Covid-19 pandemic and both news and life was shaped to some extent by it. Vaccines were had, masks worn and plenty of tests were done. It looks like 2022 will continue along the same path.

## Highlights

### Mountain Bike

I bought a Mountain Bike in January and from April have been regularly going out riding it with friends and solo. A great way to get fit and explore the paths and muddy tracks locally and even go further when time allows.

### Learning

### Mechanical Keyboard

### France

## Low Lights

### Lack of running

My left foot is still injured to one extent
