Holy shit I forgot to blog about it: I passed my A+ Essentials with 84%!!! Yes I am now learning the A+ IT Technician course work and have my next classroom session (and hopefully exam at the same time) in the middle of November! Working on many computers at the same time at the moment. I have been given another computer from a work colleague, so far it's fast but keeps on crashing. Will persevere a few more times then re-build with Ubuntu or something like that. Currently it has XP. Will be useful for me having a couple of computers so I can practice my networking skills when I get to that part of my course. I am also learning about drupal to make my brother's website. So far I've installed it and have been watching a few video tutorials on youtube about various modules. This week has been busy. Last night we went to see "The Edge of Love" at the cinema. Monday night we found a new place to live (the landlord wants his house back at this place), I've been learning my new course, about Drupal and also about PHP when I have the time. Had my French lesson on Wednesday which went well. And and and yes we're going to move in/out in 2 weeks!
