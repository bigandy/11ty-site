hands even colder than earlier. now trying out [scribefire](http://www.scribefire.com) utlity for blogging to my wordpress blog from firefox (rather than logging in everytime onto my blog). Other ways of posting include using a 3rd party tool such as w.bloggar (for windows) or drivel (for linux), and also posting by email. I will try all of these options and get back to you.
have you heard of [TSF Jazz](http://player.tsfjazz.com/?p=mp3)? Bloody awesome!
