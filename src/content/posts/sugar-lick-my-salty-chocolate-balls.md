weds lunchtime and am really feeling like getting out and breathing. The sky is perfectly crystal blue and the air suffocatingly cold, sunshine glistens off the leafless trees while the birds and flowers shiver and wait for spring to arrive. I've not been running in well over two weeks; first of all because I was chronically unwell, then i had a nasty cold and (thus) couldn't breath for shit, finally the excuse was the "couldnotbe arsed" wildcard, but the power of that is finally waning and I will have to get my skank in gear or I will turn into a slow fat genie but without the bottle. So what is the solution? (1) Badminton this evening; (2) New Running Shoes; (3) Running on Friday... AND Remind me that I've got to get the LCD Soundsystem mp3::: "North American Scum"::: Pounding Bassline. ingreatness welive.
