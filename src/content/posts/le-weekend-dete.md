The weekend. Friday evening I met up with Cesar (he's just back from his honeymoon in Thailand) at the [Nag's Head](http://www.nagsheadreading.com/ "nag's head - reading") and joined by Marion in the back garden for a few beers in the sunshine. Nice! Saturday we bought beer food and supplies from the super-market and crawled back under huge backpacks (both of our rucsacs weighed at least 20kg) back home to cook for my parents. Marion made a delicious Tagine and some tasty gazpacho, while I made [black olive bread](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Mediterranean-Black-Olive-Bread/Detail.aspx 'Black Olive Bread') and lemon sherbert (from Jamie Oliver's "Jamie's Italy" cookbook. We also did some chores and I juggled in the garden â€” something that I've not done since moving to this house. It was great to be out in the fantastic weather juggling in the garden; so relaxing and good fun too! The meal went well and it was super to see my parents who were both in top form. Today, Sunday, and the weather again was hot but mixed with some clouds. We had breakfast in the garden and read on the grass in the garden. I juggled some more and Marion finished her book. I've just finished "[Kings of the Mountains](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kings-Mountains-Colombias-Cycling-Changed/dp/1854109111 'kings of the montains')" by Matt Rendell and now I am going back to "[The Golden Notebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Notebook 'The Golden Notebook')" by Dorris Lessing.Â  I've just made some cumin bread (adaption of the black olive bread with a tablespoon of cumin seeds instead of the black olives) and I need to put it in the oven now. This week ahead: study, run, juggle.
