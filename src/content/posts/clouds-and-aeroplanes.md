for [my bro](http://www.rob-hudson.com/ "my bro's site") and all those interested in streaming radio over the internet, this is an article about [cloud music](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jan/22/digitalmusic-drm 'cloud music (guardian.co.uk)') (e.g. live.fm, pandora, deezer). i.e. music which is streamed from the internet. Is this the solution to online music piracy?
