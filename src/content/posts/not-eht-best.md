Running: "Reverse River" solo. Went out too fast, suffered on the uphill flint-path and managed to get back okay but not speedy after this. Time?? Dehydrated since drinking last night with chums from work while watching the ManU vs. AC Milan Champions league semi-final 3-2!!! And not drunk much this am. Need to eat more fruit/veg in am, drink the water before going running next time:)
