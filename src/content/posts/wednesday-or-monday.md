Back from 6 days of rest. Been for 6days in Lyon and Nuits St Georges in France for wedding of M's friends Armelle and Guillaume, to see M's uni town and meet friends new and old. Had great time, lots of sunshine and good food and wine, now recovering at work breaktime almost hometime and wishing I were back in France. Not going running tonight as it's my Mum's b'day and we're going round for a cuppa tea.
