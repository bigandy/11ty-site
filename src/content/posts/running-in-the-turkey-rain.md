It's Tue afternoon and the rain continues to fall from the blackish grey sky falling for a few more hours on what should be a sunny and warm June day. This week I am going with M on holiday to Turkey: for 1 week in the sun on the sand in the sea on the beach, soaking up rays of suntan inducing sun enjoying being a tourist in a foreign land! I cannot wait, the last 6 months since Christmas/NY have been long and tiring and I need a proper break. Shocked by the price of diesel last Thu when I filled my car up: Â£73.59 for a tank of 125.9/litre of diesel, up 20p/litre since when I bought the car back in November last year. Shocked. Where is the alternative to using my car? I use my car to get to and from work every day 65 miles a day, 325 miles a week, plus some weekend trips. That's a lot of money to pay. Option 1. travel to work by train. Yes more cheap (i think it costs Â£60 a week) but takes 3 hours there and back rather than 1.5 when driving and large number of connections mean that if any train is delayed I am very late home or at work. Option 2. Move closer to work. Not realistic at the moment. Option 3. Move job closer to home. Not realistic at the moment. Running: Last night I went out with M after work. Felt initially very low energy from day at work but glad went out. We did the same course apart from the final section. A new [\[Uni PP - 3.9miles\]](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=1954973) route. M did 3.1 miles and I did 3.9 in 25 and 30mins, respectively. Last week went out with M once (Woodley) and myself (2laps of PP). Have stopped taking the vitamin tablets since beginning (7th) of May and seeing what this makes to us. So far have less energy and more tired, but this could be to do with the amount of things that we are doing. So. Will give it another month or so and see how feeling then!
