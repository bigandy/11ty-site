Inti is the one with white patch under its chin (first two photos). Punku is the one with fluffy hair (latter two photos). \[gallery ids="1329,1327,1326,1328"\] This week we finally collected our two kittens from Marion's colleague Simon. We'd looked after their [elder brother Benny](http://big-andy.co.uk/blog/benny/) for a few days but now was the time it got real and we got our own kittens! We collected them on Weds evening and it took them a while to get used to their new house and us - Punku still needs some litter training (he doesn't like walking in the litter tray!) But they are getting crazier and crazier as each day passes. Fighting each other and playing with the home-made string toys and leaping all over the place and exploring everywhere. Taking photos of them is difficult because they move so fast and are so black. I'll continue to take lots of photos and put them up here.
