This is where I announce that my wife is pregnant with our first child. Yesterday marked 27 weeks pregnancy and the baby is due in February 2015. We have already started to take in the advice of friends who have already had babies, and given clothes from ones whose baby is now a toddler. Mothercare is already our destination when we need to go shopping on the weekend. I have built a cot, chest of drawers and wardrobe that my parents kindly bought us, and this all resides in what used to be my office. Over the next weeks we need to find some decorations for the room and babify it (weâ€™re thinking animals and owls at the moment), and buy clothes and a pushchair. At the end of the month we will start the NCT course with other expectant parents.
