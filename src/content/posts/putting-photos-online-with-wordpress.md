1.  Take photos off of camera
2.  Choose which ones you want to put online
3.  Optimise with program such as [XnConvert](http://www.xnconvert.com/)
    -   I personally like to change the size to a max width of 1000px,
    -   reduce the jpg quality to 70%,
    -   and have them load progressively.
4.  Upload
5.  Attach to Post
6.  Link with \[gallery link="file"\] shortcode
