Last week has been non-stop and knackering. I went running twice and recieved a Squeezebox Duet (for internet radio - it's fantastic!) and my pc died. Otherwise life is good! Good news: ManU are top of the Premiership for the first time this season having just beaten Bolton 1-0 in the final minute of the game. Liverpool play Everton on Mon and can go back top if they win. Tis an easy Saturday. Marion is in Macclesfield with her friends from France. I am home studying. Catching up with my course after the holidays. Almost finished the first book now. Just topics on Project Management and Security to go. Hopefully the second and third books will be more interesting. Last night I finished a book which is about the river Yangtze in China "[The River at the Center of the World](http://www.amazon.co.uk/River-Centre-World-Journey-Yangtze/dp/0140249125 'the river at the centre of the world [book]')" by Simon Winchester. In my opinion was great at the end and slow plodding at the beginning. Like the river perhaps! Well worth a read if you are either interested in China or Rivers, or both! Tonight I will carry on with my studies.
