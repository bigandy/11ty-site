This morning we went for a walk along the river to get some fresh air and were blasted away by strong in the face winds and bright blue sunshine. Keeping to my promise I did take a couple of photos but the hands were too cold to take more than that and I am only now (5pm) starting to warm up again. After a sausage and fried egg sandwich lunch (ingredients bought at the farmers market yesterday morning) we watched the FA Cup quarter-final between Reading and Aston Villa. Reading easily outclassed their Premier League opponents in the first-half and went into the break 2-0 up. Unfortunately the away team scorred three goals and Reading were left optimistically prodding and firing balls towards the Aston Villa net but could not succeed. The game finished [4-2 to Aston Villa](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8549646.stm "BBC review of the Reading Aston Villa Game (external)"). This afternoon I am listening to [Foals](http://www.myspace.com/foals "foals myspace site (external)") and [Polar Bear](http://www.myspace.com/sebastianrochford "polar bear myspace site (external)") and just about to start studing the final two chapters of the first book of my CIW Foundations Course. They both are on Microsoft Expression Web. Later I hope to study a bit of PHP.
