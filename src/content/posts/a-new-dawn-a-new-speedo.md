New Speedo for my bike! This morning I fitted it to the bike and rode to work. Normally I am happy to race cars and then take a breather, but with a device that tells you exactly how fast you are going the competitive side comes out and you have to go faster, even if you knacker yourself out in the process. The device is a [Cateye Strada Wireless 8 Function Computer](http://www.evanscycles.com/products/cateye/strada-wireless-8-function-computer-ec008446?utm_source=froogle&utm_medium=froogle&utm_campaign=froogle 'description from evans cycles').
