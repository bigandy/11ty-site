It is the second week of January and I have signed up for Reading half-marathon on 19th of March. It's been a number of years since I last ran the Reading Half and I am looking forward to returning to where I used to live and run through the streets. My aim at the moment is to go out three times a week, gradually increasing the weekly mileage. Today I went out on a four mile off-road route, it was very muddy and slippery in places. Having this race, and others, as goals will hopefully keep my motivation up when things get difficult and not see me stopping running for so long (like I did at the end of last year after picking up an injury due to over training). I would like to run a marathon this year and have already started the search for an ideal candidate as well as looking at other shorter distances (like the half-marathon and 10k).
