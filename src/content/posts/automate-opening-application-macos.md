At work we have daily standups using Zoom and my colleague Ryo asked if it was possible to automate the opening of the Zoom app in the correct meeting group at a specific time every day. 

Steps:
------

1.  open terminal
2.  crontab -e
3.  57 8 \* \* 1-5 ~/openZoom.sh  
    
4.  'esc' and ':wq' to exit crontab
5.  create ~/openZoom.sh with the following :  
    
    > #! /bin/bash -l
    > 
    > open https://zoom.us/j/<meeting-id>
    
6.  chmod +x ~/openZoom.sh

Crontab syntax
--------------

I have used 57 8 \* \* 1-5 ~/openZoom.sh and I will break that down command by command: 

*   57 - minutes past the hour
*   8 - hours 
*   \* - day (month i.e. it could be fourth day of the month)
*   \* - month (i.e. it could be 2 and thus February)
*   1-5 - day (of the week, I have used 1-5 so Mon-Fri)
*   ~/openZoom.sh - executes the ~/openZoom.sh file
