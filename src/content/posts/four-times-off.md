Running: Hard, fast, scorching. Decided to this week's Hard Run today, when I did the "River Route". Same principle as the EZ run but if I have to ask "am I going fast enough?" then I probably am not and force myself to go faster. Hahaha! Great fun. There is a good side to this torture, however, and that is I have to look at the same things for a shorter period of time. That long dragging stretch of road-running now whizzes past, and so on! Since getting back: the thighs hurt, and walking down hill from work I noticed that my ankle/shins were hurtin. Like shin spints but just when I was going down hill.
