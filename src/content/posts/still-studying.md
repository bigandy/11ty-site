It's really cold in this office where I am studying. So cold that I cannot really feel my feet. I do have some really good music - the Tron soundtrack by Daft Punk - to keep my ears warm, however, and eleven jumpers and three pairs of jeans to keep my body and legs warm. So you can rest easily in your warm offices and homes. That is all.
