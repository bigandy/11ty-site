This is an interesting experience: I am now writing this post from my iPhone. Not the easiest of experiences but allows one to post on the go, or at least compose draft posts on the go. Tonight I am going to go to my first ever twestival (charity fundraising event for the Twitter community, held globally today) in Reading. Excited and expectant but entering an unknown world: the world of people that uses twitter. Yes I have met people through Twitter and met and know a few people that use Twitter to communicate. But a whole room of them specifically there because of Twitter? Looking forward to going on holiday with my girlfriend Marion. Where are we going? That's a surprise that I will find out the answer to on Saturday morning when we arrive at the airport for our flight. Which airport and what destination? Both of which I am dying to find out!
