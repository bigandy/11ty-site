The head was hungover but the feet needed to move, plus I'd made a promise to Cesar that we'd be going running in the morning. Seemed like a good idea last night. Yes, and it was. The sun was shining and the air was cool and for the first time I could wear my shades. I ran to Cesar's place and then we jogged to and around Prospect Park. Windy in parts but fantastic way to blast away the hangover! 4.69miles in 37m06s. [Prospect Park with Cesar \[4.69miles\]](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=3363718)
