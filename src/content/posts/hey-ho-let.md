Now I am hungover, and punishing myself by being awake. Last night I met with Martin my best friend at school from age 5 till uni. Lots of drinking, catching up had a great time played darts somehow drunk lots did I say that? Now now NOW I still am punished for it, uck. I have been a good soldier lately however, going running and swimming a lot, walking everywhere and eating good food. Running: 7.08 "Hilly Route" (time taken: unknown); 11.08 "Reverse Wellington College" 26mins; 14.08 "Wellington College" 24mins; 15.08 "Muddy Lane Lakes" 55mins (7.23miles); 17.08 "Broadmoor Devil's Highway" 42mins (5.83 miles); 20.08 "Reverse Wellington College" 23mins; 21.08 "Ridges+Ambarrow" 41mins; 23.08 "Reverse Muddy Lane Lakes" 51mins. Swimming: have started swimming every week with Marion. Main stroke is breaststroke at the moment although I want to improve front-crawl, back-crawl so I don't die if I do more than 5 lengths at once with these strokes.
