this is where it happens? Ok then you've got me as I sit here in my office listening to Noah and the Whale's new album (the beautiful sad _the first days of spring_). This week has gone, shuffled quickly and noisily past, like the wind buffeting the trees in the garden. It's been emotional, and sad, and happy, and mad. But soon it is over.
