# This Year

## Fitness

-   Run 1,000+ miles
-   Run my first marathon (this can be on my own if I wish)
-   Drink more water and eat healthier
-   Join a running club when possible
-   Stretch more often (sitting on a desk all day is rubbish for flexibility)

## Reading

-   Read 25+ books.

## Tracking

-   Use a TODO app (I am using Trello) to keep track of my things I want to do. Makes it easier to see how I am progressing as I love ticking things off lists!
-   Also use a paper notebook as this is cool and I don't have to have computer access to see what I need to do
