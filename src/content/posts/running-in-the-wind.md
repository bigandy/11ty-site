Running:: Just back from the first run of the week. Monday I was ill and Tue Marion and I went to see "4Months, 3Weeks and 2Days" in Oxford. Wednesday I had zero energy or motivation and Thursday Marion and I played 1.5 hours of badminton! With still aching legs courtesy of the badminton last night I ran through Palmer Park to London Road then Kings Road past the Prison and right at The Rising Sun roundabout under the railway; over the next roundabout and before crossing the bridge turn right along the River Thames until it meets the Canal when go over bridge follow canal and then turn left up Cholmeley Road before taking Liverpool Road back to Palmer Park and home. I'll Call this "River Cholmeley" and it took 36 minutes. I have lost my running watch so I have to use the clock on my mobile for timekeeping. I check it before and when I get back. Not the best accuracy in the world. Was very windy out there. The Thames is very high although there was no water on the footpath this week.
