Following up from my decision to [change web host](http://big-andy.co.uk/blog/changing-web-hosts/) I have decided to go with AWS. Now I've migrated this site to a Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 Micro instance (free for 1 year) and after getting used to the different way of doing things (control is all command line, no web interface at all) I'm extremely happy with the outcome.

The server is in the cloud (in Ireland - they have lots of clouds in Ireland as it rains a lot) and on a non-shared host it's much much faster (for me in England) and I am getting to learn more about Apache and MySQL and command line.

There are a few things that I need to figure out : setting permissions while doing a Capistrano deploy, setting up email (for the Contact Form).

I'm still migrating sites over from one host to the other so the Photos are currently not accessible.
