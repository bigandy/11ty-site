This morning marked the beginning of Summer (time) and signalled a spring forward in time and renewal in the air. Yesterday Marion and I went to Southampton primarily to go to the Apple Store and buy an iPad2, go to Ikea, and enjoy the sunshine. I was utterly destroyed to find out that all the iPad2s had already sold out so I would be returning empty handed and after having a trial of the tablet in the shop it really feels amazing but I'll have to wait a few weeks before I can get my own. To lift myself out of the gadgetless depression we got some coffee and cake from a cafÃ© and sat in the grass in the park and chilled. We then went to Ikea and bought a few things for the house and dreamed of the time in the future where we will have a home for ourselves (rather than rent a furnished house with someone else's fashion and decoration). The weather was really hot when we finally stepped outside so we bought lunch from M&S and took it to the park and soaked up the sun. In the afternoon once the sun had disappeared behind clouds and a cold wind had started we went to a pub and watched 5 minutes of England vs. Wales in 3D with no 3D glasses (a recipe for a big headache) and then returned to Reading.
