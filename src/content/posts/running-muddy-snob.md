in the middle of the night I write this. For the first time in 3 weeks I went running (at lunchtime) and now I am feeling fucking knuncked. In the ferocious wind, in the howling gale, the rain was blown forcefully into our souls (and faces). Yet this didn't dampen our minds, nor darken our spirits, because we were out running and little else mattered. Of course it was bloody difficult to stay upright, with the slippy sloppy mud (result of supersaturated earth from last week's snow and rain) and buffeting wind. Feeling as though I needed to blow away 3 weeks of cobwebs I strode ahead of the others on the "Flat Woods" route and promptly got lost, eventually doubling back after losing Steve at the 3/4 point and then going through some of the earlier section of the route and making it back just after Steve and Dan (but before the others). I reckon it took me 45 mins to do the 5-6 miles (highly approximate!). Fantastic to get out again :)
