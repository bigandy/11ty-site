Last night I went running with my friend Alejandro - aka Ale - around Prospect Park. Not run with him before but was good to do, not fast but somehow I managed to injure my right shin. Second run of the week. Hopefully this'll be better before I next go running. 137 days until Reading Half-marathon. Must keep the training going. If I make three times this week I will be super-happy. Need to get some proper running shorts and gloves. Now that winter is here. Dark dark dark as we went across the park but nice to be running on grass better than pavement.
