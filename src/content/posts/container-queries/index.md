## What are Container Queries

If you want to understand Container Queries first you have to understand media queries. Media Queries are primarily queries on the viewport dimensions of the browser. For example

```css
@media (min-width: 600px) {
	.title {
		font-size: 3em;
	}
}
```

This would style the `.title` class when the viewport is wider than 600px. Otherwise the style will fall back to what is outside of that query.
