Sorting out photos on the computer. Have not put any photos online in a long time but looking into sorting that out. Also looking into batch processing, web optimising and such like.

-   using xnview to batch process (image optimise for faster download speeds, all in one go);
-   organising photos on computer into logical folders

Now I have done that I will move onto my studying. I am on the final chapter of book1 of my CIW Foundations Course:Â  Site Development Foundations. Off I go! See you later:)
