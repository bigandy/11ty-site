yes so another beautiful day in paradise. this day spent reading in the garden, finishing "Shalimar the Clown" by Salmand Rushdie, last Sunday's newspaper about films music and books. Yes just did 100 situps as my posture has got to a stage where I need to make it better. Been juggling in the garden, left shoulder really hurts still. Yesterday: cycled on hottest day of year to my parents, 11 miles in 45mins. Along roads and quite often subject to side and face-on winds. Great. Have now found my cycling shorts so ready for next week's twice daily commute to-from work:) Hot hot hot. Yes so the reason for yesterday's visit was to see my grandma, and my parents too. M met me there and we helped cook dindins: lasagne and then rhubarb crumble (i made the crumble: 9oz (1/4 white flour, 1/4 wholemeal flour, 1/2 oats), 4.5oz butter, 4.5oz sugar) for topping). Makes huge difference not taking the car every/anywhere and I am liking it very much.
