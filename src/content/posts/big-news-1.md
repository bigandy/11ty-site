I have some really fantastic news to share with you. Marion and I are going to get married. I proposed at the top of Glastonbury Tor on our 3-year anniversary which was one month ago. We're both really happy and are starting to think of places in France where we can get married. It'll be somewhere next to the sea, either the Med (where Marion grew up) or the Atlantic (where her parents live now).
