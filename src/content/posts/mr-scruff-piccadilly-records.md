During my university days I lived in Manchester and frequently\* went to Piccadilly records (and Vinyl Exchange) and Mr Scruff was one of the excellent artists that kept me sane. So when I saw that [Mixmag had interviewed Mr Scruff IN Piccadilly Records](http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/100-vnyl-welcome-piccadilly-records) I had to share it with you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BStO2u4W0mo \*thank god for the student loan, I bought an incredible amount of tuneage from those record shops along Oldham Street!
