Good afternoon! A week off in sunny Turkey with M and a week back in UK now almost settling back into life again. Great holiday in Marmaris: week of sitting on the beach soaking up the sun just what I needed, still have some of the suntan left as well! Went swimming and walking every day, though the copious amounts of ice-cream and tasty turkish sweets and patisseries balanced that out! Yes went running on Monday evening with M after 2 weeks of non-running. Feels good though looking forward to going at my speed! Have been cycling to and from town regularly in evening, to Persepolis last night and to-from town plenty of times on the weekend. [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) is the perfect (free) software for organising your to-do list, [Thanks to my brother Rob](http://www.rob-hudson.com) (see photo) for showing me wonderful tool!!! M and I, with help from my bro (thanks bro!), are organising the next Pidgeon Walking Weekend and this is the perfect tool for visualising what needs to be done and what to think about. [Here are our Turkey Photos](http://www.big-andy.co.uk/Photos/Turkey08/) and hoping to put some more online soon of life and chocolate and sunshine.
