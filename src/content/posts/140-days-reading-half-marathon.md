Today marks the end of British Summer Time (BST) and start of Reading Half-marathon training. Today also marks 140 days until the race and its the first time I've run in over a month. Just a small run to get me back into it and I plan to go running on Tuesday to continue my training process. Start small aim big! Looking forward to Tuesday!
