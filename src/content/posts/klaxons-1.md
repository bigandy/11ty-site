It has happened, I don't know how but it has happened. Indy, alt, decent... whatever you want to call it,,, it has returned to the cool. Klaxons are number 1 in the album charts, replacing The View. How the fuck, and when the fuck, did this all happen? Should we take interest in the charts NOW??? Does it matter? Mika is still number 1 in the singles (that should be re-named "the mp3" charts?). Thanks to Grace for giving me a copy of Just Jack's "Starz in their Eyes" and some juicy chinese music. You are a star!!! Appears that there is one more gorgeous person in the Family that I have yet to meet. Have you seen Jennifer Hudson? Wow she is hot hot heat! Like Kate Hudson and Rock Hudson she shure is the fucking bacon, yum yumm yummm!!!
