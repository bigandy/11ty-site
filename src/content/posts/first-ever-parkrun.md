On Saturday morning I set off out of the door at 0830 to run to the start of [Didcot Parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/didcot/) a weekly free timed 5k running route. After the recent hot weather it was much cooler (13°C) and I jogged there too quickly so I had at least 15 minutes trying to stay warm. I chatted with someone who'd already done the course before and then the volunteers also gave a description of the route. Three laps of a grass field then a mile along a paved footpath. I finished in 21:50 at a pace of 7:00 mins/mile, that final mile was tortuous just following someone trying to get closer to them but not managing, then sprinting the final 20 meters, knackered but relieved that the suffering had finished. \[lazy\] \[/lazy\]
