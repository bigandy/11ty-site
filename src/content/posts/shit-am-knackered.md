Running: after playing football after work on Tuesday I went running on Wednesday: "Stables" in 32 minutes, solo, weather really good, bit too hot and sweaty, fast plodding really;) After having a pint with Marion (we sat next to the canal in the gorgeous sunshine!) I cycled Marion's bike (much too small for me - good speed however!)Â Â to Tom's house last night after work to watch champions league final. Tom cooked a fantastic dinner (sausage/pasta from Jamie Oliver - tres delicious!) with Cesar, Tom's buddy (what is his name?) and Liverpool were not lucky this time around. Really shattered right now, almost slept through my stop on the last train last night, ugh. Holiday for 4 days from tomorrow!!! Going to the Big Smoke tomorrow, then Cotswolds for weekend.
