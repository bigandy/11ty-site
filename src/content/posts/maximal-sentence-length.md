Earlier today I read why [gov.uk use sentences less than 25 words long](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2014/08/04/sentence-length-why-25-words-is-our-limit/) is an excellent idea and one that I have started out on this site. It focuses you the author on creating short concise sentences with no cruft, and does not alienate or confuse readers.
