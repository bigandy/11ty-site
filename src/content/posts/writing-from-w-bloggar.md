While I listen to the latest podcast from [The Big Web Show](http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/16 'big web show #16') (a weekly show about different topics related to the web, hosted by [Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/ "Jeffrey Zeldman's Site") and [Dan Benjamin](http://hivelogic.com/ "Dan Benjamin's Hivelogic Website")) I try out a new tool for blogging.

1.  **w.bloggar**
    I used to use w.bloggar a very long time ago when I was first getting into the blogging game. That was a long time before Wordpress' in-browser compose post function was usable. Now going back I can see that w.bloggar is still a great way of composing posts, there is no distraction and you actually feel that you are sitting at the type-writer and composing "serious content".
