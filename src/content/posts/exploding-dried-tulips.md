Hi Hello Good Afternoon! It's Friday sunshine dazzles the outerworld while in the innerworld I get ready to go running for the first time along the Thames from Walton Bridge (near work). Since March began I have run Reading Half-Marathon, been to Nottingham and the Peak District, went running with Marion, been to see "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" at cinema, "Shoot 'Em Up" and "The Bourne Ultimatum" on DVD. Huzzah just now they have announced the draw for the 1/4 finals of the Champions League: Arsenal/Liverpool; Roma/ManU; Schalke/Barcelona; Fenerbahce/Chelsea. Wow I cannot wait to see it! Have entered a 10k race in April and going to enter a half-marathon in April. Going to get changed now. See you. \[... at home. 1500\] Heavy legs, didn't find the route that I wanted to do... But I feel Great! Great that I went running, that I went running before driving home to a hot shower, great that I tried a new route. I have just entered the Bracknell Half-Marathon on 27th of April to add to the 10k race I am doing on the 13th. Now It's really the weekend and Marion and I are going to a party tonght then tomorrow into London to have a test of some new bikes, watch the rugger and get some art for the housewalls. Ment to piss down all weekend so w/e will prob involve cinema or DVD too. Yessah! in the morning there were twelve spotted doves walking in a long evenly spaced line down the middle of the street, if one of these white purity peace-keepers were to fall all the morning would be less and I'd have had to go back to bed.
