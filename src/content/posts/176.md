Friday lunchtime and the weekend beccons, the sunshine dazzles and the blue sky dotted with white fluffy clouds. Been a long week but a short week and another week less before I start my new job, one week less at my current place and only 22 journeys (that's approx 750 miles) before I can rest the car and get out my bike. Have not run all week although went walking a lot last weekend, several times this week and also to-from town on bike twice too. Went to see Indy 4.0 last night although entertaining it played too much and tried to be humerous. Watch out for the ants. Semi-finals and finals of men and woman's tennis this weekend. Serena and Roger all the way. Have a good one!
