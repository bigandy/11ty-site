The year that was 2010 was for me a very good one and I completed a number of goals and I will summarise them here. I completed my Masters CIW Designer course. I proposed to my now fiancee Marion. I did the toughest long-distance walking paths, Corsica's GR20. I passed my photography course. I changed career to become a front-end web developer for HeathWallace. I quit my job at Thames Water. I embraced Technology and bought an iPhone. I look forward to this year 2011 to see what it will bring to me.
