Second run of the week after doing the same route in much colder conditions after work on Monday (22m14s though I had to wait to cross traffic for at least 30s). Listened to Mew and Air and Foals. I went swimming on Tuesday when I did 20 lengths. This is the start of the beginning of my return to fitness.
