England have just beaten [a soggy Australian cricket team](http://www.bbc.co.uk/go/homepage/int/sp/shdr/hs1/t/-/news/sport1/hi/cricket/england/6349169.stm) in the second match of the One Day Triangular Tournament Final in Australia, and thus WIN the Final 2-0!!! We have gone from being on the losing end of a 5-0 thrashing in, and thus losing, the Ashes less than 2 months ago, to handing out a 2-0 thrashing to the Auzzies, huzzah. We RULE!!! Yesterday I went to London to see "The History Boys" at the Wyndham Theatre (near China Town). It was the best play I have seen this year, it was so funny, clever, unpredictable, exciting! I chose to sit in the cheepo seats, soo high up at the very back of the theatre that got initial vertico cos the stage soo far down. The play, written by Alan Bennett, was about a group of 8 superbright 18yr-old boys preparing to take the Oxbridge entrance exam (after completing their a-levels, potential oxbridge students (up until the 1970s) went back to school for a term to prepare to try to get into Oxbridge) and the play dealt with this, the possible homosexuality of their teachers and "the boys", with clever interaction between the cast ensamble. The head teacher was more of a business man, concerned with buzzwords, management, he didn't give a fuck about the actual learning, just the results and the figures. There was a battle between the new teaching methodology (employed by the new "Oxbridge Graduate" teacher) and the old (as taught by their ancient General Studies teacher). Plus there was a not-so-bright kid, who wrote everything down, for contrast. [Disco to drop Ivan and Co at end of 2007](http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2007/feb07/feb10news)
