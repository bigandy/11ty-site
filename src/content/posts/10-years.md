Thinking about [Rippin Kitten](/rippin-kitten-miss-kitten/) and this years [Tour de France](http://m.guardian.co.uk/sport/tourdefrance) especially [stages 17 and 18](http://inrng.com/tour/#Stage17) brings back memories of the summer of 2003 when I was Kayaking in the French Alps, seeing my first Tour de France and missing my graduation ceremony. That summer I graduated with a degree in Chemistry from the University of Manchester. Now 10 years have passed! I graduated with a degree in Chemistry, moved to Cambridge for 3 years and then travelled through Europe via InterRail, and walked the Coast-to-Coast path before moving back to Reading and meeting Marion. Two more years and we hiked the GR20 (Europe's toughest long distance walking path). I completed my Web Design qualification and changed career to become a web developer. We got married, had our honeymoon in Peru and got two cats. Now we're waiting to move into our first home and move to Didcot (hopefully early August).
