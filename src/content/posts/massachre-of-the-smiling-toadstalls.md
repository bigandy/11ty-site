Running: easy recovery after yesterday's long run, 5 miles in ~40 mins. Actual distance and time may vary! "Walters Wood" was the route and i felt good this afternoon having done the run in comparison to the morning when I was sloggy. Film: I went to see "The Blades of Glory" after work this evo. Wanting a no-brainer entertaining comedy that's what I got. Averagely funny, quite entertaining. Okay film.
