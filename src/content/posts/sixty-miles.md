It's been a bloody long time since I rode that far on a bike and the final 10 miles were those of a suffering knackered empty excuse for a cyclist who is paying for his lack of fitness and over eager speed-demon start. On Sunday one week after buying my Bianchi road bike I did the medium Evans sportive ride. I started five minutes after Marion (she did the short route) from Whitchurch Hill and the pace was very fast with lots of people racing from the off, spurring me to go fast and overtake them. Lots of people were in groups but I was solo. I stopped at ~40 miles for a snack bar and again at 45 but this was not enough and I really struggled in the final 5-10 miles. Yes I completed the route in 3h35m with average speed of 16.5mph and max of 38mph. Looking forward to doing more rides, joining a cycling club and getting faster!
