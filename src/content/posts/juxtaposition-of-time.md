listening to Gilles Peterson using the cans that Marion bought me for my birthday is one of life's greatest pleasures. That and sorting things out. I took Marion to New York City at the end of Oct for her birthday and it's been a harsh week recovering from the tiredness and jetlag that hit us as we came back to this side of the Ocean. I took hundreds of photos on my newly bought super-wide angle zoom lens (Nikon AF-S Nikkor 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5G ED DX to give it its fullest of full titles!) and now am in the process of sifting through them.

## Sunday #1

you can see the weather was superb. this was taken while we were watching my cousin Ethan's soccer game. my cousin ethan (yellow, number 14) on his 9th birthday tearing it up. and there were still some leaves on the trees. We went walking with Sean to cure our jetlag. break at the top to catch our breaths. with the trees around us it was difficult to see the sky. big breath for birthday boy! 9 big ones.
