Just under two weeks separate the end of my Chemistry career and the beginning of my new career in web development. I have a job as Front End Web Developer for [Heath Wallace](http://www.heathwallace.co.uk/ 'heath wallace') starting on August 2nd based here in Reading, UK. I am hugely excited about the change, something that I have been working hard to achieve over the last two years with my web design course, reading books, writing code, learning and continuously studying hard.
