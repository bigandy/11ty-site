Woo-hoo! Spring is finally here, ofically and in real-life. A whole new season and to celebrate this I am writing a post about my Pi springing back to life!

### Raspberry Pi

I am sure every engineer has at least one raspberry pi sitting in their cupboard/drawer gathering dust, and I was the same. I decided to change that and have been spending some evening and weekend hours putting it to a very good use (I think so) using it to control all my internet connected stuff (Hue/Sonos/Plugs...).

### What?

I've got a Raspberry Pi 3 with a breadboard attached to it. I have a small array of components (switches, LEDs and sensors) which I am using to control internet accessible devices. On the Pi I have also installed a Next App which I am using to display the status of each of these devices, as well as an API and pages to control the devices too. I am using the same API to control the devices from the web (local area network only) and the physical buttons, this is so I don't have to write everything twice.

#### Why?

Sonos has two apps (one for the "old" amp in the lounge, and one for the "new" Sonos:1 that are in several rooms), both are slow and rubbish and usually all I want to do is play one of my favorites (radio station or playlist). I want a simple way of playing x without having to grab my phone, wait for the app to open and load, change the favorite. Less phone time the better.

Then over Christmas I bought some internet connected Plugs to be able to control lights in the lounge and also turn my laptop and office lights at the end of the day - this gives me a good reminder I should be going to collect the kids from nursery / school and end the working day. In the lounge I can control the lights with Google Home ("OK Google Lounge Off").

There is also the Phillips Hue app. Jesus. So many apps.

#### Future

Be able to press a button so my lounge lights and plugs turn off. No talking required.

I recently bought a Raspberry Pi Pico micro-controller that I want to connect to my Macbook Pro and a large Button. What will the button do? Who knows.
