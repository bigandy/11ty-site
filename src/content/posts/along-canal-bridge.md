Not having time to run to or from work I needed to go out running at lunchtime. It was raining and muddy too as I ran along the canal listening to Laura Marling and Mariachi El Bronx on the mp3 player. Tough at the end but nice to do a different route. [The route](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=3488095 'route map of canal bridge run [external link]') was 3.91 miles which equates to a 7min40s /mile pace.
