I am a person that lives in Oxfordshire with my wife and children (1 daughter, 1 son). I love long distance running, following the cycling, and learning new things.

In my day job I am a front-end developer at Venture Harbour where I do many different things including React, Electron, Chrome Extension, Node, CI setup, performance, as well as CSS and HTML and vanilla JS.
