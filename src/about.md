I live in Wallingford, Oxfordshire with my wife Marion and children Arthur and Emma. I love long distance running, reading magazines, following the cycling, and learning new things.

In my day job I am a software engineer at Venture Harbour where I do many different things including React, Electron, Chrome Extension, Node, CI setup, performance, as well as CSS and HTML and vanilla JS.

## Magazines

Here are some of my favorite magazines:
- [Offscreen Magazine](https://www.offscreenmag.com/)
- [Sandwich Magazine](https://sandwichmagazine.com/)
- [Eye Magazine](https://twitter.com/eyemagazine)
- [Bicycle Quarterly](https://www.bikequarterly.com/)
- [B](http://magazine-b.com/en/)
