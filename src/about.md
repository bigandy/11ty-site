Hi there! I'm Andrew and I'm a software engineer. I live in Wallingford, UK with my wife and two kids. I love running (the muddier and the further the better), reading and learning, watching the cycling on TV and going on long country walks, playing with the kids, and seeing family.

In my day job as a software engineer at Venture Harbour I do many different things including React, Electron, Chrome Extension, Node, CI setup, performance, as well as CSS and HTML and vanilla JS.
