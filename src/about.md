Hi there! I'm Andrew and I live in Wallingford, UK with my wife and two kids. I love cycling both in the outdoors on a Mountain Bike or touring bike, running (the muddier and the further the better), reading and learning, and going on long country walks, playing with the kids, and seeing family, and exploring the world around me.

In the day I am a senior software engineer where I do many different things including Typescript, Next.js, React, Electron, Chrome Extension, Node, CI setup, performance, as well as CSS and HTML and vanilla JS.
