A quick post at the end of a very busy week of work. I am getting my head around SVN and the workings of life as a developer. I'm looking forward to learning more and increasing my skillset. I am reading a book about Accessability "Building Accessible Websites" in the evenings and beginning to pick up some jQuery too. The more you know the better a developer you are. So I've been told!
