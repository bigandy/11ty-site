Yesterday \[04.02.09\] Second bridge along the canal. Some snow (in the shade) and some slush, but was great to get out there running. Seriously need some new headphones as the left headphone is just distortion whenever there's any bass. Fortunately I have ordered a pair of Grado iGrado phones which should arrive this week!
