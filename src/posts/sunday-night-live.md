![Muffins](/shared/2009/02/p10205701.jpg "Muffins") Jazzanova. Gilles Peterson. Snow. Cool. Yeh it's Sunday night and the weekend is over. So what. Spent most of the weekend studying. Almost finished the second book of the CIW Foundations course, final chapter on e-commerce to read then it's on to the Networking book. Friday night Marion and I went to Hobgobblin for a pint then to the cinema to see [Slumdog Millionaire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/ "Slumdog Millionaire (imdb)") which we both really enjoyed. Managed to stay inside all Saturday but did the cleaning and re-arranged the lounge so DVD now on hifi (so good for playing films through speakers, and also for playing CDs on hifi. We don't have a CD player you see, just internet radio, and an MD player, so playing the many CDs that I have lying round the place was impossible (unless burned onto computer and streamed through the internet radio). It's much nicer to play and hear CDs from the CD-player rather than the computer. Don't you think? Listening now to [Gilles Peterson](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/gillespeterson/)'s show (from last Thurs). Yes. Now. This evening, I am making chocolate chocolate chip nut muffins. They're out of the oven and cooling down. I smell their smell on my fingers. Ate too much of the dough so not really hungry at the moment to be honest. That's the cooks' right, to eat the cooking before it's made. Which is why I love making deserts because one can eat the food before it's made. It snowed. For a few minutes. Now going to eat some noodles then to try the muffins. Adios!
