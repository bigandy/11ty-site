For the now and here spring is with us, the blossom on the trees, the birds and the flowers are all fighting for audio and visual supremacy, warm bloody warm gorgeous days sunny and blue skied and perfect. I love spring! Running - Last Friday we did "Walter's Wood". Today (monday) we did "Stables" and I really pushed it. Without the two undone shoe lace stops I would have gone faster but. Ground really drying out, mud gone and can grip the earth again. In t-shirt and shorts, really gorgeous day out there and soo warm out of the brisk wind along the base of the hill.
