## What a year 2019 has been!
Christmas this year is in France with the inlaws, Marion's brother, his wife and their new child, and my parents. Before that I have written a summary of this year.

## Highlights:

	- finally we're in our house in Wallingford!
2. Family
	- Arthur started school
	- Travelled to Croatia for a holiday

This year has been a year dominated with exercise and collecting Vitality Points.

	- Ran and exercised lots
	- Took a 6 week swimming course
	- Ran two trail half-marathons, a 10k and a Park Run
4. Work
	- Worked on Serene most of the year learning lots of Electron, levelling up my React and Node
