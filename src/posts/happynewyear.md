right, first of all i know it is already the 13th of jan and i have not written here this year but i have been bloody busy... so. Happy New Year! Right now I am in Cheltenham, visiting my brother and working up the energy needed to go into town and see the place (Rob needs his sleep and is sleeping). I got here remarkably quickly last night, after realising that no-one was leaving in the right direction from work to give me a lift to the station I stomped down down down the muddy sharp steep tabogan run hill that takes one from work to the river, to the station in a mile of very un-flat walking... after I crossed the river I realised that if I continued walking I would miss the train so I sucked in a deep lungful of river air and bombed it (ran) to the station... bursting lungs and cascading anti-overheating juices aside I made the train with a few milliseconds to spare. Yes! The journey, viaÂ  Didcot and Swindon, arrived only 2 hours later and I missed most of it because I was playing with my new laptop. I watched the first half of "Thankyou for not Smoking" and did a few other things. Last night. Rob cooked a fantastic curry and we watched "Ong-Bak". WOW what an awesome film; I watched it Thu too, but I had to watch it again with the bro as the fight scenes are the best that I have ever seen, sometimes grusome but mostly jaw-droppingly dazzling. I got this laptop, a dell inspiron 1501 (my first laptop, and first new computer in 8 yrs!) on Thursday. Yup!
