Marion and I are going tonight to Paris for a long weekend staying at her friends house looking to see what one of the world's most amazing cities has to offer and to consume delicious food and drink and soak up the Parisian atmosphere. Wow we need a break from the UK it's been such a long time since the summer and since we went to France. Times are a changing as I have a new job starting after we get back next week, we are looking for a place together and I am also looking for a car. Wow at the moment I am pretty stressed out but I am sure things will settle down once I have the car sorted. What have we been upto, what have I been upto since the last post? I have had a number of job interviews, I have had a birthday (Happy Birthday Me!!!) and have accepted one of the job offers. I have been running, indeed Marion is also a runner now and goes running 2 times a week lunchtimes at work (just like I did) and we both go swimming together once a week too. Running: yesterday: "Ambarrow Muddy Lane" in 32mins, Tuesday: WC in 24mins. 23-Oct: CBH in 40mins; 25-Oct: Rev-WC in 24mins; 26-Oct: CDN: 43mins.
