[FFConf](https://2016.ffconf.org/) is a front-end conference held in Brighton every year and here are my notes from the talks that stood out:

### Future CSS - Rachel Andrew [SLIDES](http://www.slideshare.net/rachelandrew/nextlevel-css?utm_content=buffer7cb6c)

Rachel covered a number of different future / current in some browsers CSS such as flexbox, grid, @supports, shapes and path-clipping, initial letter, css variables and calc, position: sticky and scroll snapping.

*   flexbox: already [good browser support](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox)
*   grid: coming to browsers in Spring 2017. Where flexbox is for one dimension, grid is for two dimensions. Can be used alongside flexbox not either or.
    *   [Grid By Example - Examples/Tutorials/Videos](http://gridbyexample.com)
    *   [How to enable](https://igalia.github.io/css-grid-layout/enable.html) in Canary/Firefox/Opera/Safari
*   @supports feature detection with CSS. e.g. [Supports will Change your Life](http://www.lottejackson.com/learning/supports-will-change-your-life)
*   [Shapes](http://webplatform.adobe.com/shapes/) + Path-clipping [cool clip-path tool](http://bennettfeely.com/clippy/)
*   position: sticky; Firefox, Safari, Canary. [Overview on CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/position-sticky-2/)
*   [scroll snapping](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-css-scroll-snap-points/) Supported by Firefox, Edge/IE11/Safari (partial).

### Technologic (human after all): accessibility remix - LÃ©onie Watson - [SLIDES](http://ljwatson.github.io/decks/2016/ffconf/index.html#)

Excellent accessibility talk with reference to screen readers, writing HTML with aria-roles.

*   Aria roles
*   Aria name e.g. aria-labelledby
*   Aria state e.g. aria-checked
*   Use inbuilt HTML semantics e.g. use button not div with aria-role="button"
*   Test without mouse, using screen reader
