<p>I am Currently Doing this:</p>

- Coming to terms with the result of the World Cup Final (France lost on penalties).
- Coming to terms with the fact that the World Cup is over and there is no longer live sport to watch during the evenings.
- Putting Christmas decorations and lights up.
- Attempting to put curtains up in the lounge.
- Laughing at what is going on at Twitter with Musk deciding that people should not be able to share links to other social media platforms, then putting a vote out to see if he should leave Twitter.
- Looking forward to spending some time with family and friends over Christmas.
- Recovering from an [epic winter bike ride with friends last Friday afternoon](https://www.strava.com/activities/8257390391).
