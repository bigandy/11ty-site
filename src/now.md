## Life

Life is super busy with work, kids and the World Cup going on. In my spare time I have managed a few MTN Bike rides. Days are short with the Winter solstice less than a month away.

## Learning

I am currently doing a month-long project where I create a web component a day using Lit. The site is (https://web-components-november-2022.netlify.app)[https://web-components-november-2022.netlify.app] and I am learning every day. It is great because it forces me to learn something new every day and produce something at the end of it to share on the internet.

## Fitness

Mostly mountain biking and walking at the moment.

## Family

Both kids are now in school although sometimes Emma does not enjoy going in the morning they both have good time and talk about it in the evening. Marion is super busy with her job. Marion and I went to Iceland earlier this month which was incredible. The kids were looked after by Marions parents.
