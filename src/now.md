## Life

Covid continues. Homeschooling Arthur since the beginning of the year. So far Emma is still in Nursery which makes it a lot more straight forward. In comparison with the first homeschooling last year the level expected of him and us is a lot higher. The tech is better (Google Classrooms, plus videos from the teacher) but it still is us being a teacher to our son who doesn't really want to learn from his parents about Phonics, writing and Maths. My parents are helping too which is a really big thing and allows Marion and I to continue 100% at our jobs. It is tiring but manageable so far.

## Learning

At work we've just switched tech stacks from Firebase, to using SQL, Apollo, GraphQL, and Prisma. It is a learning curve but after a couple of weeks it is getting better. Also we're using Material-UI for our components so everything is developing at a much faster pace.

## Fitness

Running five times a week. I have upped my weekly mileage from 20+ a week to 25+ a week and I am still adjusting. With homeschooling + working this is all tiring but I am enjoying discovering new routes and getting out of the house running either before or after the kids are up, or at lunchtime. A few times with Marion when my parents are here with Arthur.

## Family

Marion and the kids are well. Emma in nursery. Arthur at home. I think Arthur is pretty bored of homeschooling by now, and fed up that he can't see his friends very often. Marion or I often work into the evening and spending time together is rare, but its great when we can go for a run together as we know we're away from the home and its just ourselves.
