## Life

The world it is still in the midst of Covid. So not much is going on at the moment other than walks in the countryside, running along muddy leafy autumnal tracks and reading lots of books, watching some films and listening to music.

I have been really enjoying the compressed cycling season on the television and today was an exceptional one with one of my favorite races the "Ronde van Vlaanderen" (Tour of flanders) won by Mathieu van der Poel by just 10cm.

## Learning

At the moment I am attempting to complete all of the [CSS Battles](https://cssbattle.dev/). So far [I have done 30 out of the 60 challenges](https://cssbattle.dev/player/bigandy). As well as this I continue to learn more about Design Systems and Storybook which is pretty interesting stuff.

## Fitness

Running before the sun comes up, or at lunch time, and on the weekend. Not as much as in the summer, but still 3 or 4 times a week. Also going walking a few times a week.

## Family

Marion recently started a new job in a different industry so it is a big change for her and she is really enjoying it. Arthur is in year 1 at school and Emma is at nursery.
