<p>I am Currently Doing this:</p>

-   For the last week I have been heavily getting into the build process of my T3 Strava app. I now have a production app available to view at [strava.andrewhudson.dev](https://strava.andrewhudson.dev) that has a database, gets data from the Strava API and views it in a number of different ways. I am able to login to the app, sync to get more data from the API, update the data in the database and in Strava via the API. The data is currently viewable in a table view and also a list view. I have a big list of things that I want to add including dataviz, better styling, incorporating it inside a Tauri application (so it is a desktop app that I can use on my machine). [Code can be found here](https://github.com/bigandy/mono/tree/main/apps/t3)

-   Applying for new jobs. I have had a number of interviews and I am applying for more roles.
-   Enjoying Zwifting in the garage and have recently beat my PR for the Alpe du Zwift (the highest steepest mountain on Zwift) with a PR of 58:25.
-   Reading: ["REAMDE" by Neal Stephenson](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10552338)
