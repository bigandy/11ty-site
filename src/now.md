## Life

The World is _still_ in the midst of the Corvid-19 pandemic. We are on the cusp of Autumn. We went to France for 3.5 weeks in the summer to stay with Marion's parents so they could see the grandchildren (and us) while we worked for the first 1.5 weeks and then had a super holiday for the next 2 weeks. The weather was super hot and we went to the beach or town, saw family, ate icecream, swam in the sea and went for run and cycling expeditions.

Now we are back in UK and quarantining at my parents house, again so that my parents can see the grandchildren (and us) and allow us to work. But being stuck at the same house unable to get out and go to the shops or run is a bit difficult... especially for the kids who can't see their friends or go to the play park and go on the swings/slide etc. For us at least there is the distraction of work during the week. The weekends are for reading and catching up with the kids and my parents.

## Learning

At the moment I am learning about React Native. At work I am moving on to another React project which will be exciting as it is almost totally from scratch.

## Fitness

Running is taking most of my time and enjoyment which is great because I love running in the mud and cooler weather. I have not been to the gym which is something that will change when I am able after the Virus. I am running three or four times a week, totalling 20+ miles a week. After quarantine I think I will increase this to 25 miles a week in the next few weeks now that I might have more time in the days to do so.

## Family

Marion and the kids are as well as can be during the pandemic. Arthur will go into year 1 at school and Emma will go back to nursery.
