Last month I decided to go running every day. That's 30 days of going outside into the fresh and cool/warm/hot air and going running. Day after day after day, running. To make things interesting I decided to do a range of different routes so that I was never running the same route from one day to the next: short distance, long distance, medium distance, tarmac, off-road, to the beach (on holiday) and so on. I did my first ever parkrun, ran a half-marathon distance, and joined the local running club. I ran 140 miles (225km) in 30 days making an average of 4.6 miles a day. The furthest I ran was 13.3 miles (last Friday) and the shortest was 2 miles (a few different occasions). How far will I run in October?
