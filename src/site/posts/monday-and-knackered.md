Every time I open up the "New Post" section of my blog admin and wait for the words to come to my fingers. The space to write is so large (I have a 23" monitor and it spans the entire width of the page) that I am always put off. So I now will try other methods to put down my words.

1.  **Method 1** is QuickPress the in-built window on the main page of wordpress' admin section. Room for 4 lines of text at a time, no more, and breadth and space for lines of words and sentences to form quickly without the distractions of an empty page of whiteness.
