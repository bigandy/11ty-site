Monday: running; first half of "Walters Wood" really good, then I couldn't be arsed and so let Steeve catch up overtake and put 10m into me. Caught him and won token sprint at end. He's not a sprinter, he did well to catch me, but today my bones were slower than the silver wind. At work a new person started in our lab, a girl no less, so mebe life will be a little more interesting in the 9-5. TBH it's been a long slog since Jan: too much work, too much stress, not enough fun. Have you heard of "The Knife"? Electronic awsomness. they're here: [the knife](http://www.theknife.net/o0o.html)
