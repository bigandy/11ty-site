First of all I'd like to make an announcement: I'VE FINISHED WAR AND PEACE!!! In under 2 yrs I have battled through the many hundreds of thousands of pages, through France's unsuccessful battle with Russia. Fave character: Rostov. Really great book! Now have moved on to another Russian author:Â "Crime and Punishment" by Dostoevsky (he's just killed the old hag!) Running: "Walter's River" with Cesar. took us 45 mins, at his pace, was pleasant enough. Â Â
