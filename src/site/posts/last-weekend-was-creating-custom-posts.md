Last weekend I realised how little I actually knew about Wordpress (the CMS/blog system that powers my blog). My intention was to learn how to create custom posts and have a different page of the blog where these posts would appear. For example, I would create a running log and every entry would go to the "Running" page. After a weekend of pulling my hair out I managed to create these custom posts, with taxonomies. But the other more interesting part of my goal was not successful. I have a book called "Wordpress Bible" and this is helpful but it feels as if everything in the back end is gobbly goop. Perhaps I need to take it one-step at a time and break down into components and understand each one before going right into the deep end. Anyway that is for sometime in the future, not now, as I am going to the [New Adventures in Web Design](http://newadventuresconf.com/) conference on the 20th in Nottingham, and this Friday Marion will join me so we can go for a weekend camping in the Peak District.
