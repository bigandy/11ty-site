This morning not feeling very well I had to skip brekki so that I arrived at 10 o'clock absolutely starving and in need of energy and some coffee. Also as I feel that this blog is in great need of artwork and photography I took a photo of the new book "It's only a Movie" by Mark Kermode I started last night.
