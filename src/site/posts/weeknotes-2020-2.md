- Back at work on Monday and planning for the Winter Retreat at work.

- We went to London for the weekend staying with my brother and his partner Megan. They had kindly bought us tickets for the Shard for Marion's birthday so we did that on Saturday afternoon. It was incredible. Such an amazing view from the top across the city and beyond. On Sunday we went to Spitalfields City Farm after a morning spent going to Columbia Road Flower Market and a delicious brunch at their flat.

- Exercise: Running Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Walking every day. 40 Vitality Points!
