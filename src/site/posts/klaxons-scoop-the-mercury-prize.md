Hi news just in [Klaxons Scoop 2007 Mercury Music Prize](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6977433.stm) and wow what a great band they are not. Sure I like their music, went to see them live in Reading. But surely they are not the best band on the list. Running: Today: Dell Lane Lakes in 53mins; Yesterday: WC+ (in the dark so had to walk sometime) in 25mins. Running session today: I took my Learn French mp3 and listened to the first lesson. Great stuff, learnt some new words and phrases, great! But not the best accompanyment to go running with, not fast enough. Nose full of lung butter, top of chest hurt a little. Have had a nasty cold the last week and now getting almost over it.
