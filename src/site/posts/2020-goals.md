## 2020 Goals

I will turn 40 in October so this year is all about me doing stuff that I want to do.

1. Fitness
	1. Marathon
	2. Dulwich Dynamo
	3. Serpantine Swim

2. Health
Eat better, drink less alcohol, look after myself. This includes going to the dentist, registering with the local doctor and drinking home made delicious coffee. If 2019 was a year of doing lots of exercise I want 2020 to also be about this but more, focusing not only on the exercise but the nutrition behind the exercise.

3. Reading
By reading I mean both the physical process of reading words from a book or kindle, and also in the form of listening to audio books.
