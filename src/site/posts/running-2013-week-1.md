A summary of the first week of running this year goes like this. After the lack of miles over the Christmas period (I only ran once, on Christmas Day) it made starting running again more difficult. Only two times this week and I will try and increase my number to three the next couple of weeks.

1.  Monday - 4.8miles in 0:38:20 - river route
2.  Wednesday - 5.3miles in 0:41:42 - Whitley with HW

Total Mileage - 10.1 miles
