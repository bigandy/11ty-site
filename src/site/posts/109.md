Friday::: Yes, end of another fast-paced week shortened by Easter and ended by rain and wind. On Monday I went biking with Alejandro and his friend Ramiro to the Look Out. Weather was cool-cold and intermittant snow showers with sunshine bursts what a crazy day! Marion was in Macclesfield at her friend's Hen Weekend. With A and R we rode for 2 hours on single-track and off-track I getting used to my new Specialized RockHopper and Alejandro still recovering from breaking his arm last year. Ramiro ex-trials was on top form although many of his front spokes came loose. Muuuuuuddddd!!! So much mud! Wheels clogged brakes jammed rims rubbing on the brake blocks. So much water mud splattered everywhere in eyes foot mouth!!! Wow great fun! Will buy proper pedals and shoes for biking as only have flat pedals and old trainers atm. Last night I practiced balancing without moving and wheelies yes. Need lots of practice though could see improvement already! Need to work on this! Is not really nice weather out there now have an hour till I leave for home then either I go running or biking or to sleep. Am really knackered not really getting enough sleep last weekend didn;t help. Right. Rain rain rain falls from the skies. What a crappy day to be a bumble bee. This week: went to cinema tuesday saw The Counterfeiters, last night knackered but I went riding.
