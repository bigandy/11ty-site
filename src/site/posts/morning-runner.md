Some people might say that there is never enough time in the day to go running, especially with a toddler and a full-time job. But there is always time for something you want to make time for.

### Excuses

The year and a half since Arthur was born there was never time for running. After commuting back from work, then playing with Arthur in the evening, giving him his bath and putting him to bed. After this dinner, relax, bed. Where is there time for running?

### Solution

There is a solution! Go running before Arthur wakes up, before work when it is quiet and the grass smells of dew. I've been doing this for the last two weeks. It is incredible! Once I get back I've already completed something challenging so that day is always going to be a successful one.

### Outcome

I set up my running kit the night before, everything is ready so that I just have a glass of water and put my kit on and go. Anything that prevents you from running is a mental barrier so having organised the kit the decision has been made. Go running!
