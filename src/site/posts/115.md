[![](/shared/2008/04/20mins.jpg "20mins")](/shared/2008/04/20mins.jpg) Following a nasty afternoon at work I jumped into the car and drove home. Into the rain I went and out the other side just before getting back home in the middle of the exit to the roundabout was a police car blocking all onward traffic. This was a place where there were few (if any) routes around so I went back, cut across country and then got stuck in more rush-hour traffic going back into Reading. Arrived home after 90 mins in the car I needed to go out running. After yesterday's 10k race my legs were a bit stiff so I blasted around PP on the first lap and then coasted for the second. Time: approx 20mins. Distance: 2.6miles.Â  After having a shower I now am feeling much better!
