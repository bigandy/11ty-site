What began as a simple entry to life as a developer has quickly descended into a life with ten thousand different strands each taking up all of my time resources and abilities. I'm a beginner and have not done the vast number of things that they're asking me to do before. Yes I'll get quicker when I have mastered how to do it all, but for now I am very stressed.
