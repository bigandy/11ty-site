Last five weeks have been really good as I have been running on average least twice a week every week since October 28th when I woke up early to go running along the river. I have been helped by going running with a friend and also the work running club. It helps with the motivation if you have other people to go running with - at least in the tricky first month.

What differences have I noticed? Well the first couple of weeks I had bad shin spint in my right shin and this slowed me down. I've not lost weight but I have lost a bit of fat on my tummy. I'm more confident to go longer distances than I ever was before, I used to cringe at the thought of running 5 miles but I have done that on five of the running sessions, the furthest was 7.6 miles with the work club.

I think I prefer running long distances and seeing how far I can run. Obviously re-starting running is initially to train for the Reading Half-Marathon next March (now 110 days away) but sometime I'd like to see if I could run further...possibly one day even a marathon.
