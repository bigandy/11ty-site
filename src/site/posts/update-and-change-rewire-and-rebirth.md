Calm down, hold your horses, mind the gap and batton down the hatches ... outside today was an exceptionally windy day. We were sent home from work at 1530 because it was so windy (to give us more time to get home, and it wasn't really safe at work either). This blog is currently undergoing a refit as I try and work out what the hell I want to use it for, get the hang of wordpress themes, learn PHP (if I really want to make it shit-hot) and play around with the CSS. So if it keeps on changing don't worry, you have still got the right place for my blog. This weekend I am going to Cambridge for the first time since I moved out last summer. My former housemate Gyu-Hyun is moving back to Korea next month and I am going to visit him. Today after work I bought a superslim sleeping bag (it's designed for use army use in tropical jungles so it is very light (700g!) and small but will not be of any use in the outside British winter but will do for visiting people allowing me to travel light). I'll have my haircut after work tomorrow, and by god it needs cutting! Two months since I last had a chop and its getting really long.
