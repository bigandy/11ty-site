This morning was the first of Sweatshop's training runs for the 2013 Reading Half-Marathon. For some unknown reason I decided to go fast from the start so for most of the first lap (of two) I was first. Then two people overtook me as my energy and speed waned. The sessions are held every 2 weeks\* leading up to the Reading Half-Marathon and increase in mileage by one mile every time. Stats: 6miles in 45:31. \*Here's the full list of runs leading up to the Half-Marathon: » 16 December - 5 miles » 30 December - 6 miles » 13 January - 7 miles » 27 January - 8 miles » 10 February - 9 miles » 24 February - 10 miles » 3 March - 11 miles » 17 March - RACE DAY - 13.1 miles
