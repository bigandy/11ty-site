## Life

The World is in the midst of the Corvid-19 pandemic. We are on the cusp of Spring.

## Learning

At the moment I am learning about React Native. At work I am moving on to another React project which will be exciting as it is almost totally from scratch.

## Fitness

Running is taking most of my time and enjoyment which is great because I love running in the mud and cooler weather. As of last week I have also just started going back to the gym again after a few months away so I will be using that to improve my upper body strength and get some variation from something that is not running. So I am running three or four times a week, and gyming once or twice.

I'm keeping my eye out for some good running races to enter.

## Family

Marion and the kids are well. Marion's currently in South Africa for work so I'm looking after the children. Arthur started Primary School last September and is having a great time. Everyone is looking forward to the half-term break.
