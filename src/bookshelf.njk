<h1>Bookshelf</h1>

<p>This is a work-in-progress page that is pulling in data from my Notion books database (also a work in progress and really out of date!). The content and design of this page will change.</p>

<p>Inspiration for this page is:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">daverupert.com/bookshelf</a></li>
</ul>

{% for book in notion %}
	{% Book book=book %}
{% endfor %}
