I am a person that writes stuff. Other than writing I live in Wallingford with my wife Marion and two kids Arthur and Emma. I love long distance running, following the cycling,

In my day job I am a front-end developer at Venture Harbour where I do many different things including React, Electron, Chrome Extension, Node, CI setup, performance, as well as CSS and HTML and vanilla JS.
