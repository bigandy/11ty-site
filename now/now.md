## Life

I'm living in Wallingford with my wife Marion and our two children Arthur, 4, and Emma, 11 months. I am considering if I want to train for a marathon after seeing London Marathon on Sunday.

## Learning

At the moment I am learning about Express and Node and Webhooks.

## Fitness

Running and going to the gym regularly. Watched the London Marathon on Sunday and inspired to think about entering a marathon. Not London or a city one, would love to run along the trails!

## Family

Emma has been ill all week and is on medication. She is not sleeping well and this makes us super tired. Arthur woke up last night and because we have just had new blinds fitted it was too dark and he was scared. Need to install a night light or get some glow in the dark stars.
