## Life

I'm living in Wallingford with my wife Marion and our two children Arthur, 4, and Emma, 18 months. I am getting ready for Christmas and running more than before.

## Learning

At the moment I am learning about the newer aspects of React, including styled-components, and Next.js.

## Fitness

Running and going to the gym, plus running two or three times a week. Now I am just happy to be running when I can and entering 10k and 5k races when I feel like it. In 2020 I want to enter some longer races (i.e. anything more than 13 miles).

## Family

Marion and the kids are well. Arthur started Primary School in September and is having a great time. Everyone is looking forward to the Christmas break.
