## Life

I'm living in Wallingford with my wife Marion and our two children Arthur, 4, and Emma, 13 months. I am learning to swim freestyle!

## Learning

At the moment I am learning about Gatsby and Eleventy and serverless.

## Fitness

Running and going to the gym, plus swimming two or three times a week as I am having freestyle swimming lessons. What's next? I'd like to be able to swim 10 lengths without stopping. Future far fetched goal is to swim 2.4 miles without stopping (Ironman distance) but that'll take a few more sessions;)

## Family

Marion is well although her company are restructuring so a bit of stress there. The kids are well, Arthur is going to start Primary School in September and has a couple of taster sessions for him to get used to the place. Arthur will go to France for 10 days with the grandparents (hoping they will take both kids next year!)
