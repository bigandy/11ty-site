		<p>Busy Busy Week just gone. Starting last Monday I went running at lunch, just 4 miles stretching my left hamstring before, during and after the run cos it was really quite stiff and achey. In the evo after going for a few drinks with Cesar and Marion I went to see Reading vs Newcastle at the Majeski with Cesar. Reading won 1-0. Exciting game but Newcastle shudda equalised. Tuesday: Running: 5 miles solo &quot;Walters Wood&quot;. Watched Champions League round Tom's house with other blokes from work. Dire game but happy that Chelski lost on pens and Liverpool went through to the final on 23-May. Weds: Running: 6 miles solo &quot;Reverse River&quot; pain in the arse to get up the flint path but felt better in general than on Mon/Tue. Watched second Champions League semi-final round Cesar's house. Bad bad awful game. ManU piss-poor and AC Milan go through to meet Liverpool in the final. Thursday: Football. Played lots of loose passes but did some attacking. So-so game. Went to beer festival in evening! Friday. Hungover and knackered went to pub at lunchtime, then after work for 1. Watched rest of Old Boy. Went early to bed. Saturday. I drove to Cheltenham to visit my brother. Watched Manchester derby. ManU beat City in abrasive non-exciting game. Go 8pts ahead of Chelski. Go to see Cinematic Orchestra w/The Nextmen at the Jazz festival. Incredible time, only wished that I had drank more so that I could dance to The Nextmen because they were awesome!!! Sunday. Saw Spiderman 3. Really enjoyed it. Lots of choices for the young 4-legged octoped, tale of revenge and recrimination and darkness, of forgiveness and betrayal. Watched Chelski lose title by drawing with Arsenal 1-1 (both sides could have won it in the final 5 minutes) then drove back home. Read some of War and Peace then went to bed early-ish. Today: was going to go cycling with some friends but weather = shite and we agreed to do it another day. Cooked chocco cake from Mum (her birthday today: Happy Birthday Mum!) did food shopping and now trying to finish off War and Peace.</p>
