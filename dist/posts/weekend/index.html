		<p>This is Friday afternoon and I am about to leave for home. The week has been long and tiring but I played badminton with my school friend Rob! Last weekend I went to London with Marion. To a music festival with my brother and his friends Summer Sundae in Clapham Common with bands I am Kloot, King Creosote and some others... the festival was sponsored by the ice-cream manufacturer Ben &amp; Jerrys and all around the festival site there were tents dishing out the many B&amp;J ice-cream flavours! The sun was out and we chilled, had ice-cream, and listened to the music. It was great! Fun follows fun and on Sunday Marion and I went to the Saatchi Gallery (recommended to me by someone I met at a party - very colourful!) and then to Brick Lane. I love music and one of my favorite shops is Rough Trade off Brick Lane. After having some delicious food from a market we went to RT and M bought me the latest White Jeans [is that what they're called?] album and had a good look around. Another passion of mine is Graffiti and we found a road called Bacon Street where all the walls are fantastically painted (graffiti'd). Many cool and different paints there! I have put the photos we took on my flickr page (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andysan">http://www.flickr.com/photos/andysan</a>) if you want to check it out. This week has been a matter of survival. It's been tough at work and after work I've been studying or reading a lot. So it was great last night to play Rob at badminton and throw away some of the stress. Today I am aching all over but it was great fun! Thanks Rob for chasing me so we could organise this game! This weekend we're going to Winchester and then on Sunday to my parents (to see a whole flock of relatives). Tonight we're going to the cinema.</p>
