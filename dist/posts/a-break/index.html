		<p>Marion (coucou mon amour) is in France, I am doing a clinical trial, I have started a new job, Marion and I have found a new place to live, I am looking to buy a car. Life is extremely hectic at the moment. The travelling is killing me. I travel in the morning to the clinical trial lab to deposit blood and urine, get weighed; then I travel to work via train (35mins) and walking (8 minutes) then I work a full day until 5.30 and walk to the station and catch a couple of trains finally arriving at home at 7pm. Have dinner according to the food diet that I have to follow and then speak to Marion on the fone. Knackered knackered knackered. I need a break. I need to go running. I did go running on Tuesday, 1hr at 11.7kmph on the treadmill for the study. Not proper running outside but hard work running on the treadmill. Never done that before, preferring more to go running in the outside world and feeling the freshness of life on my skin (rain, wind, snow, sunshine, etc!). I have to follow this controlled diet so I am not allowed certain foods, and NO ALCOHOL, I cannot wait until Saturday when I can drink and eat as much of whatever I want to, and go running too!!! Yes!!! Tomorrow night I will go to Reading and meet up with the boys to watch the England footie game vs Austria. No booze for me but it will be good to get out on the town and see friends. Marion and I went to Paris at the start of the month, taking the Eurostar on a Thu evening and arriving at her friends' house via another set of friends. We had a great time, I met with lots of her friends and saw much of the sights of Paris by foot. <a href="http://www.big-andy.co.uk/Photos/Photos_Paris_Nov2007/">Here are the fotographs:::</a> . Great food too, I love French food!!! Especially love patisseries, chocolateries, supermarches, creperies (crepes and nutella are simply devine!!!), and so on :) We stayed at Helene's place first (she was on holiday) and then were shown the sights of Paris by Line, Jalabert and their 9mth-old baby Lisa. The Eiffel Tower by night is simply stunning (see the fotos!)<br>
<img src="http://www.big-andy.co.uk/Photos/Photos_Paris_Nov2007/Andrew's/thumbs/IMG_3068.JPG" alt=""> and lisa is soo entertaining! Marion and I went to a restaurant and had simple delicious food. Next day Marion and I went to Monmartre and had crepes for brunch, found Line, Jalabert and Lisa and did more touring. In the evening Marion and I took the sardine train to see another set of her friends Didier and Lucie and we had the most amazing chocolate fondue ever, preceeded by salad and duck. It was great, with fresh fruit just dipping the stuff into the molten chocolate and eating it.!. Choco-holics heaven :) Following morning Marion and I stocked up on French goodies, then to Paris central again via a chinese supermarket for essential foods! We did a walk along the Seine and then had chocolate crepes for lunch. Marion and I then went to see Line Jalabert and Lisa one more time and taste their amazing food. Jalabert owns and runs his restaurant and the food was as you'd expect, sumptious!!! Lisa was very entertaining too!!! Had to get up really early on Mon am to catch the Eurostar back to UK, with just made croissants and pain au chocolat for our brekkies. The best I've ever tasted :) Im knackered and will continue the tale next time! Best Wishes, Andrew.</p>
