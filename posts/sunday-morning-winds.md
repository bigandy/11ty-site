Good afternoon. Cold air returns to Reading. Just back from Sainsburys to stock up on milk and something for dinner tonight, and this week's [Observer](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/ "Observer (UK)"). This morning, as well as finishing the first book of CIW Foundations, I cleaned downstairs and talked to my bro, who's now at work. Going to have lunch now.
