Good morning. the wind is blowing across this friday blue-sky morning. re-partitioning old crappy computer with gparted live. Passed my CompTIA A+ IT Technician Exam with 93%!!! Now can move on to do CIW Foundations section of my course. It's Friday and I am knackered as it's been a very long month, a very long week too, with moving house revising and studying for the last exam, French homework and both Marion and I had birthdays too. After the new year life will slow down a bit. Grooving to School of seven bells. Almost time to goto Work. See you later.
