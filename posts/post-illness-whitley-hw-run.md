Last night I went for a run with the HW club the same route as last week. It was cold, much more so than last week, and icy in places. I was recovering from illness but still managed to go. Lungs bursting and heart pumping I ran with Jason (Marathon Man), cutting back every so often to catch back with the others. 6.3 miles in 54:09.
