saturday afternoon. week went fast past the eyes and now again its the weekend. last week: rained a lot but manged to get outside a lot too. I played badminton on Thurs with Rob (I played better than last week), went to see "The Taking of Pelham 123" (poor poor film) at the cinema. We had a picnic by the river last night; and walked along the river on Weds eve... it was great to be in the outside and not stuck inside at home. Tonight we're having a bbq and I have made [caramel shortbread squares](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Caramel-Shortbread-Squares/Detail.aspx "caramel shortbread squares"). Now I am going to the shops and get things for later. Have a good weekend!
