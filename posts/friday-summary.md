Writing this is in itself quite knackering because I have tired and drawn myself out with all the running (and running about) that I have done this week. When I realised last Sunday that the Reading Half-Marathon was just 5 weeks away I figured that I had to start my training right away or forgo the attempt this year. So I have run every working day this week, five days in a row, and I have to say that it has been a real awakener. The first three days went well, I ran either to or from work and it felt good to be running again (I'd not run since the middle of December), but the run on Thursday was tough and I imagine that the run this afternoon will be something of an out of body experience;) I have the start of a cold and I am feeling knackered and empty which are both symptoms of over-doing it. I am going to take a break from running tomorrow and I think that I will go for a run along the river on Sunday, a longer run than I have done so far. Possibly I will run all the way to Pangbourne and get the train back. I'll let you know when I have done it!
