We have finally moved house!

*   Last week was super stressful and tiring
*   Marion went back to work
*   Emma started nursery and didn't sleep well all week
*   We moved house on Friday to Wallingford from Cholsey finally completing our move from Didcot (we had to rent while our new house was being built).
