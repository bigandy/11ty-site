[![](/shared/2008/04/spring_flower_t2519.jpg "Spring Flower")](/shared/2008/04/spring_flower_t2519.jpg) Spring Is Here! April Showers, Sun, Snow, Furballs, EVERYTHING!!! Yes it's Monday and I finally get round to up-dating the blog! So what have I been upto since I last wrote? Yesterday I ran a 10k race (Marion ran a 5k race at the same venue). Last weekI signed up to do a Masters CIW course (which begins later this month). I did a First-Aid Course. Been to France for a long-weekend to visit Marion's brother and parents. Seen lots of films and DVDs (Grindhouse and Son of Rambow last week; 27 Dresses and 13 Going on 30 the week before) and listened to lots of good music (including Radiohead, Adele, Sebastian Tellier; online including Indy103.1 and radioactive.co.nz).
