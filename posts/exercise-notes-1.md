In the first of possibly more than one I review what I have been doing in terms of exercise in the last week. I will see how I feel about them. Could be changed to monthly.

This week I have been running three times, and the gym twice. I've decided to aim for some realistic but challenging running goals, they are sub-20min 5k, then sub-40min 10k. For the first one I want to this in the gym first then outdoors. Running on the treadmill at the gym is a more controlled environment because you can enter a pace and then you stick to it whereas outside you need to navigate a course and remember to keep running as fast as possible.
