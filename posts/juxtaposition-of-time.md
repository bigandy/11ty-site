listening to Gilles Peterson using the cans that Marion bought me for my birthday is one of life's greatest pleasures. That and sorting things out. I took Marion to New York City at the end of Oct for her birthday and it's been a harsh week recovering from the tiredness and jetlag that hit us as we came back to this side of the Ocean. I took hundreds of photos on my newly bought super-wide angle zoom lens (Nikon AF-S Nikkor 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5G ED DX to give it its fullest of full titles!) and now am in the process of sifting through them.
