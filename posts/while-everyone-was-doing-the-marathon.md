... I too got up bloody early and went running! This morning I drove to the Look Out where usually my running club (sandhurst joggers) do their Sunday morning long run. Ahah. I knew it was the marathon this morning so I wasn't sure that anyone else would be there from the club - NO - but I had a plan of a route that I could do myself. Until I met another runner by the name of Paul. He usually runs here on a Sunday (either with SJ or [Bracknell Forest Runners](http://www.bracknell-forest-runners.org.uk/index.php)) and I joined him for 7 miles of single track. I will never know the route but I did occasionally recognise places that I have been through before. Got back after about 50 mins, where BFR were warming up for their run (they meet at 10, SJ at 9am). After driving home and getting showered I turned on the TV coverage of the London Marathon to see Zhou win the women's race, and a little later Lel win the men's race. It's still going on, the fun runners (haha!) are still struggling through the record heat (max of ~25C) as I write this. Will find out tomorrow how well Paul and Liz from work did. 7 miles of off-road singletrack running in ~50 mins.
