[![](/shared/2008/07/morning-300x2001.jpg "morning")](/shared/2008/07/morning.jpg) I am now on two week holiday after 8 gruelling months of getting up at 6am, leaving at 6.30 for 1 hour commute, working till 16.30 and then second 1 hour commute before getting home at 17.30. Knackered, Stressed, Violated, Poluted, Hungry. I now have a new job (just three miles each way) in Reading, starting on the 28th of July, and will get there by bike or by running. Yesterday I read a lot, used linux (after installing Ubuntu on the computer my brother's old computer - cheers [bro](http://www.rob-hudson.com)), got infuriated with the noise coming from the knackered fan in said computer (and with Drupal) and set off on my bike to ride to Maplin in search for a replacement fan. The route is the same as I will use for getting to my new job and was really hilly and v.hard work. After finding no suitable fans in the shop I tried a different route home but took a wrong turning and instead of getting the map out I did a bit of high speed exploring, then when knackered got the map out and rode home. In the evening after M had arrived home and we had eaten dinner we watched ["Priceless (hors de prix)"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482088/). Really funny film, Audrey Tautou sexy pouting seductive actress in same vain that Audrey Hepburn was in "Breakfast at Tiffany's"... which reminds me that I have a whole box-set of Audrey Hepburn films to watch.
