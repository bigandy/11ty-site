"Kings of Leon - The Runner" on current listen, torrential rain on the glisten outside wow what a nice sound they make! Had a couple of job interviews today, now really tired, have another tomorrow. Started doing situps and pressups but skin a little sore on back as have been doing a lot of them and skin not used to it, hah! Situps good for posture, core stability and also for running form, while pressups are good for the musle, yes! I went running with the running club last night, was slower than last week but we did manage a few fast reps and up some hills too, reason why other people were not up for fast running was that they were racing over the weekend and were tired. Have been invited to the Weds sessions so may check them out in the future! The Weds sessions are longer, 8-10 miles and a continueous pace rather than the looping that happens on the Monday nights. Am very tempted, although will have to do more running and get even faster first! Something to aim for!!! Last week I did the VO2max test (as part of this running trial I am doing) and got a figure of 63.75. Bloody hard work. Went walking with Marion on Sunday, looking for a long route that's exactly what we did. From here to beyond the Look Out in the woods, then back again, we did 25km (saying the distance in km is much better cos the figure is larger!) and Marion almost killed me when we worked this out! "Were you trying to kill me" she said,,, it's excellent preparation for the GR20 I think! England are through to the Rugby World Cup Final after narrowly beating France on Saturday. Wow, amazed to think that this is the same squad of players that we watched just last month playing so poorly. Come on England!!!
