*   Bro and his g/f stayed over with us last weekend
*   Went running in the rain on Saturday morning (new rain jacket is excellent) and got lost, had to ford deep stream got totally wet and muddy - double win!
*   Went to the gym 3x. Finally bought my first pair of running headphones (Jaybird Freedom - going to try them out tomorrow at the gym)
*   My weight is down to 79kg.
*   Emma has decided that she doesn't like sleeping in the night so we're all super-tired.
