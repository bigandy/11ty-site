### current

I've been learning a lot about CSS3 lately. Having bought a copy of Andy Clarke's [Hardboiled Web Design](http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/) I have also started to do some 2d and 3d transitions. While I cannot use these in my working life it's great to be able to experiment and learn by experiment on my own test sites.

### future

Soon in the future I hope to make a start on re-designing my own website and blog, using HTML5 and CSS3 techniques to enhance it all with a template for the whole non-blog site, and a different one for the blog.
