I've been a keen user of [google inbox](https://inbox.google.com)Â for over a month and here are my initial thoughts. I love it! Plus points:

*   ability to tick all of the emails and threads that you have read or actioned and not see them on the main page
*   set up to-dos.
*   the design is really something special, it focuses you on the task in hand and looks stunning too.
*   I love that you can pin emails,
*   delay reading emails until later (e.g. tomorrow, next week, or some specified time).
*   automatic categorisation of emails into groups such as "Social" or "Purchases" or "Travel",
*   delay reading these categories until a specified time each week or day.

Minus points:

*   Have to click on chat icon to then open new chats could this have been incorporated into the plus icon at the bottom right?
*   Difficult to see whether other chat people are online or not (unless they are using Inbox already)
