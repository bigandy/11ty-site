Friday: legs like lead weights all morning before the run, like heavy weights during the run and in the afternoon after work I could hardly walk up the hill to home. I ran "Stables" on my own (the others are running in tomorrow's (Sunday) Reading half-marathon so had the day off) but I did see Roger who ran the same route but in the other direction. I felt that I had more energy for the final hill compared with recent efforts and felt good when I got back. It was quite cold in the wind and overcast and cool throughout.
