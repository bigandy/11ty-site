Good Evening, just back from the second run of the week. This evening I ran along the River Thames to the boat house and back in 33mins. Monday I ran along the river and then through town in 26mins. Today I'm feeling more alive than after Monday's run. Last night I went to the Berkshire BCS CV Clinic at Reading Town Hall. It was quite useful to speak to the chaps there, and I have taken many points from the evening.
