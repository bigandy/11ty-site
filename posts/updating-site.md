Currently I am in the process of updating this site. I have already switched to a new theme “v4” and I am using Bower, Gulp, Foundation 5, Sass, jshint, nodesass. I have switched the typography over to use Sentinel (via typography.com's new cloud typography service) and the body is (currently) Open Sans… soon to use something different, probably via typography.com as well. Instead of spending months not pushing what I have done, I'm doing changes and pushing changes. So things will break, and things will change.
