Last night I watched this video about connecting socket.io and WordPress for realtime update of WordPress content. This is incredible! https://videopress.com/v/FzBGgDr9 Related to this I have been learning about programming IOT (Internet of Things; in my case it is Arduino and Raspberry Pi and electronic components) that I want to be able to control via a webpage and store the information in a Database. I have already followed a tutorial connecting a Angular page with my Arduino board.
