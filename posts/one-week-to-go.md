What a week this one has been, returning to work after two weeks ill (tonsillitis / Quinsy â€” not very nice). Last night we ordered a fridge and the night before a washing machine. Still need to order a matress otherwise we'll be sleeping on an airbed. Currently on the lookout for second hand sofabed and sofa. Time is moving very quickly. We've waited so long to move house and it's crazy that its almost here. Just one week away! The next days will be spent enjoying the sunshine, packing, and finding that mattress!
