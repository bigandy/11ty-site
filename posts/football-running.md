cycled up the hill on Monday and I could not fit the running kit into my bag so I didn't go out in the freezing cold bitter wintry lunchtime. Tuesday I walked up (and down the hill) and yesterday (Weds) I went running! We did "Extended Long Toll" and I did an extended version of this ;) as I got ahead of myself and took a different (longer) route! In the wind it was bloody chilly but in the shelter the air was warm. Today (Thurs) I played footie with the blokes at work. We lost, damn!
