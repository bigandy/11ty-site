Looking out of the window (I am doing a lot of this recently!) all I can see is good weather (sunshine, blue skies, green grass, chirping birds and so on!) but I hear that there is going to be some snow. Looking at the five-day forecast Mon and Tue promise snow and cold temperatures. We have been living in a heatwave since last Friday. Not running today, too painful after playing football (for the first time in >2 years) with the blokes from work at lunchtime yesterday. I will try to go out on Sunday. Weds: new route:: half "River Route" and half "Walters Wood" (i think I added the Walters wood extra bit myself - I was running solo and there was no one to tell me where to go!) I cycled up the hill from Pangbourne Station to work on Weds morning. ~1.5 miles 10% up up up. Really not the thing I want to ever do again (subject to change of heart!) but worth it for the ride home!!! Almost crashed into a car because I was going so fast: flying round a bend and a group of cars were stopped, waiting, to pass a parked car... need better brakes, better gears and a better bike. Huh.
