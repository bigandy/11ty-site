Running: second day in a row, today's run was a medium paced new route which is a mish-mash of two other routes so I'll callÂ "Banshee wind". Has it all: roads, tracks, woods, fields, views of river and hills both up and down (of course!), I reckon we covered at least 6 miles in ~50 mins. For the first hour after getting back I was not feeling good, the stomach ached and the mind throbbed. Now, a couple of hours later, I still am a bit warped but I gradually am getting to feel better. Rahaha. There is a rest from running tomorrow. I will play footie instead :) A different type of exercise. More sprinting and sudden changes of direction needed. The other two quarter-finals of the champions League are tonight butÂ I won't be watching... unless I am stranded in Reading and the only option is to go to the pub and watch footie, haha! In a few I will walk down the massive hill and catch the train to town and watch "Sunshine" at the pictures. Adios Amigos!
