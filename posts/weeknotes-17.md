This was the last week for me:

*   A lot of [other people are doing weeknotes](https://adactio.com/journal/14955). I personally love doing them as it gives me a chance to reflect on the past week and share some personal things that I would normally not write.
*   I ran a [12 mile long run home via Goring along the river](https://www.strava.com/activities/2206638011) which was probably too much for that day and I was super knackered and dehydrated for the rest of the evening. Nice route though!
*   Marion and I went to Cotswold Distillery and stayed in the Cotswolds for an excellent overnight stay while Arthur and Emma stayed with my parents.
*   I discovered [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), bought [andrewhudson.blog](https://andrewhudson.blog) domain, hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and it just works. Super easy to create a new post or page, push the code to Github and it will be deployed automatically.
*   I have been writing these weeknotes in iA Writer (then copy pasting into WordPress) and use markdown so the Eleventy process would be much easier.
