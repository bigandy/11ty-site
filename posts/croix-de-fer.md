So I have a new bike. My new bike criteria was for a 4-season, commuter, explorer bike, I chose the [Genesis Croix de Fer](http://www.genesisbikes.co.uk/bikes/adventure/multi-sport/croix-de-fer/) with [Topeak rack](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/topeak-super-tourist-dx-rear-rack/), [SKS mudguards](http://roadcyclinguk.com/gear/sks-bluemels-mudguards-review-7746.html) and [Ortlieb panniers](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/ortlieb-back-roller-classic-panniers/). Last night I rode it back from the shop in the rain and with a rucsac on my back (the panniers have yet to arrive from Wiggle) and it was a good experience, my first with mudguards. Need to make some adjustments, and swap the SPD peddles from my MTN bike, but looking forward to taking it on trips soon.
