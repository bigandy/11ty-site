We are proud and happy to announce the arrival of our Arthur Hudson born on 8th February weighing 3.5kg. I've returned back to work after 2 weeks paternity leave and time has flown past since then. Now he's 5 weeks old and growing fast, starting to speak fluent gaggle gargble, sucking his thumb, and smiling at us. We've just started to read to him before he goes to bed. Last weekend we went to Suffolk with his Grandparents to meet the extended family (my Mum's side) including his great grandmother, various great aunties and uncles and so forth, and in May we will go to France to meet the extended family there. 0 days old: ![day-0-with-mr-fox](https://big-andy.co.uk/content/uploads/2015/03/day-0-with-mr-fox-768x1024.jpg) 10 days old: ![day-10-mr-fox](https://big-andy.co.uk/content/uploads/2015/03/day-10-mr-fox-685x1024.jpg)
