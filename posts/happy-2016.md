It's the 4th of January and my first day back in the UK after an fantastic holiday with family in France - the food, weather and company were excellent, and Arthur wants to walk everywhere and has learned how to stand up with help of furniture. It's that time of the year when resolutions are made, but this year I will continue with mine from last year, and add some more:

*   Continue Learning JavaScript and French
*   Increase exercise (running and cycling)
*   Reduce amount of stuff I have (by selling or recycling)
