Brad Wiggins, British cycling god, has today [signed to join the British pro-team "Team Sky"](http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/bradley-wiggins-signs-with-team-sky). This is awesome news for British cycling and I hope that this can bring more cyclists onto the roads and into jerseys to battle it out for medals and glory for Britain. Today sucked. Really tired from the running and studying that I've been doing and a crappy day at work. It's the Christmas party tomorrow so there's that to look forward to! Hopefully I can go running before work tomorrow, either then or on Saturday.
