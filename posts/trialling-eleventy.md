title: Trialling Eleventy.
description: I wanted to be able to write without having to fucking login to WordPress, I didn't want to use Jekyll or Gatsby. Thus I am using Eleventy.

I have been using WordPress to write for a long time but lately I have been wanting something different, seperating the place where you write from the internet and allowing one to focus on the writing not the process of putting the writing live in a web browser.

I have used Jeykll in the past but that process was much slower than I'd like. It felt like going into the stone age - Ruby, poor developer experience.

## Requirements of a new blogging platform

1. Uses markdown
2. Uses JS
3. Browser sync and local server easy to setup and use
4. Easy to get started with a blog with archive, tagging and (if possible) ability to schedule posts

## Now I have an Eleventy Site on [andrewhudson.blog](https://andrewhudson.blog)
