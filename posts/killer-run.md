[![](/shared/2008/07/panic_attack-225x3001.jpg "panic_attack")](/shared/2008/07/panic_attack.jpg) Running: Just back from my first run in 2.5 weeks and was great fantastic awesome to kill myself for the name of getting fit, losing weight and generally feeling much bloody better than those sedentary folks. Was just going to do the regular 2 laps of Palmer Park, which to be honest is really dull and boring, but instead I felt like going further and doing something a bit more challanging. So I did "[\[Tesco Route - 4.32miles\]](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2059717 )" in 32mins with some traffic lights and a stop to do up my laces. Weather was good although quite windy, lots of sun. Shoulders really painful for some reason. Miles Remaining: 540.
