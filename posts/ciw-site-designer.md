Web-design has always been a passion of mine and two years ago I started a course called Masters CIW Designer through a company called Advent Training. While progress has been at times fast I still have not finished the course and now that Advent Training have gone bust my training is being provided by Computeach and I have a deadline of July 17th 2010 to finish the course. There's nothing like a deadline to focus one's attention and I am cracking on with the course material!
