[![](/shared/2008/07/cavwin5th-300x2191.jpg "cavwin5th")](/shared/2008/07/cavwin5th.jpg) when is the summer gonna start? today rained from 6am till now (9pm) non-stop. Managed to get out at lunch for a walk with enormous umbrella. Had to re-attach wiper blade on motorway in rain as almost fell off. Cavendish won [stage 5 of the Tour de France](http://www.cyclingnews.com/road/2008/tour08/?id=results/tour085)!!! Awesome dude! He has already won 2 stages in the Giro d'Italia earlier this year. Come on GB!!!
