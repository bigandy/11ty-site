http://vimeo.com/47428975 This morning I had the pleasure of watching this excellent talk from Interlink Conference by Jessica Hische, who has been one of my heroes for a while. I never knew she was so funny and she gave such an excellent presentation about her career and the projects that she has been involved in. I'm really looking forward to seeing her talk at [New Adventures in Web Design 2013](http://2013.newadventuresconf.com/) in Nottingham in January.
