17 days of excellent sport and fantastic atmosphere have rocked this country following the London 2012 Olympic Games. Now, sadly, they have finished and life is somewhat flat as a result of this. No ferocious patriotism, no fantastic atmosphere and more importantly no sport to follow. How will summer ever be the same after this?
