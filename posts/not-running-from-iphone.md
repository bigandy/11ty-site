This year I had to pull out of attempting the Reading Half-Marathon because of injury to my left knee I sustained from crashing my bike. Now that spring is here - you can tell by the relentless rain and grey skies - I want to start going running again. Seeing the many thousand runners participate in this years race (we were spectating from the bottom of Russell Street at mile 7 of the course) just makes me want to go out and run. My knee still hurts. The road back will be long and bumpy. But I am ready for the journey back to fitness.
