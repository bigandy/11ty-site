The new <picture> element is incredible if you want to serve different images based on the width of the browser that the user is viewing your site on. The syntax is

<picture>
<source media="(min-width: 1400px)" srcset="largest-image.jpg" />
<source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="large.jpg" />
<source media="(min-width: 750px)" srcset="medium.jpg" />
<source media="(min-width: 500px)" srcset="small.jpg" />
<img src="fallback-image.jpg" />
</picture> 

The media attribute tells the browser at which width (or more specific which minimum width) the image should be shown. The srcset attribute gives the location of the file as src does in usual <img> element tags.
