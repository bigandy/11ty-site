This week has mostly been about:

*   Studying Advanced React and GraphQL course
*   Going [for a run](https://www.strava.com/activities/1906502974) and realising I am _still_ hopelessly unfit
*   Discovering that there's a new Murakami Book out (thank god for Amazon's next day delivery!) called [Killing Commendatore](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Killing-Commendatore-Haruki-Murakami/dp/1787300196/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539847367&sr=8-1&keywords=Killing+Commendatore)
*   Devouring [Eye Magazine issue 96](http://www.eyemagazine.com/magazine/issue-96)
*   On Sunday it tipped it down with rain and we spent the day inside in front of the open fire (we've always wanted one and our current rental place has one so we have to make good use every occasion we get!)
*   At work I learned how to write a google sheet query to pull a sub-set of results from one sheet into another; and wrote an alfred workflow to close all of my applications.
