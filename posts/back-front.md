Monday: went running with Marion: two laps of Palmer Park. Pushed her perhaps more than she wanted to be pushed but that's what running's all about;) Got this Half-Marathon on Sunday so I want to do more running this week. Last night: felt like sleeping not doing much so didn't go swimming. Did however goto the pub by bike in evening; really fantastic day so was still warm in evening! Life is expensive at the moment. Going to Twickenham to see the Guinness Premiership Final on 31st May! Tonight ManU play Barca in the semis of the Champions League. Now now now I am at work, and break is over and I gotta go back to work.
