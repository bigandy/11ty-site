Since last time I have:

*   Been on holiday with Marion and the kids to the French Alps for friends' wedding.
*   Turned my blog into an Eleventy + Gatsby Experiment. I have stopped writing in WordPress and now write in Markdown so as better to compare Gatsby and Eleventy.
*   Started freestyle swimming lessons (I have now done 3 lessons, half of the course)
