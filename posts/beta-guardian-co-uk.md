Yesterday I read that the Guardian website is [currently being re-developed](http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/developer-blog/2012/oct/18/responsive-design-guardian-introduction) and is [currently in Beta](http://beta.guardian.co.uk). The site is going to be responsive, mobile first, using [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) (a OOCSS methodology which I am currently reading up on) and [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/). It is incredibly fast and from my point of view it looks beautiful.
