Sitting here in the break room for the second of my IT courses. This is CompTIA A+ IT Technician. The B&B I stayed at is cheap and basic, the owners watched TV at high volume till 1130 last night so I am still really tired. Otherwise there are 3 others on my course and it's quite interesting so far. Wish I were on real holiday as I am pretty knackered recently. Need to go running, and evacuate the stress. Have started doing pressups. Need a haircut. Know of anywhere in Kidderminster?
