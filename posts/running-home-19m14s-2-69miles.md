Tonight I ran [home from work - 2.69 miles](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=3477810  "Running Home Route (external link)") in 19mins14s which equates to a 7.08min/mile pace . Not momentous in distance but definitely the start of the training for the Reading Half-Marathon (which will take place in less than 5 weeks time) and something to do every day or every other day for the time between now and 21st March.
