Welcome you wonderful people, I am very happy that you stopped off to look at this first posting of my newly born blog, what will go here, I have a few ideas but now is not the time nor the place to share them. Hah. My eyes are sore from too many hours in front of this computer diddling and daddling with bits and bobs of website and blog development. I'm listening to [RadioActive](http://www.radioactive.co.nz), a New Zealand radio station that I have grown attached to for the last couple of years since stumbling upon it somehow... It is fantastically excellent... Right now I must bid you an excellently good night and hit the sack for much needed rest. Until next time. Andrew
