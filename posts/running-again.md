Yes so I am back running, three times this week so far and it feels great! With my new Polar Heart Rate Monitor watch I can see how much I am killing myself and exactly how long my runs are (rather than using the clock in the kitchen when I get back through the door as I have been using). Sunday in bloody freezing weather I did WC in 24m20s (Max HR: 200; Av HR: 183). Tuesday I made up a new route comprising lots of hills: Mickle Hill, the road route to Crowthorne and back, through Sandhurst to Rackstraws XR and then double back to home via Wellington Road. I call this "Sandhurst Night Hills" and it took 32m26s (Max HR:203; Av HR:184). Tonight in the horrible drizzle and rain I did another new night run comprising of my running clubs' Handicap route and the to and from home. This I name "Crowthorne Handicap Night" and it took 44m18s (Max HR:185; Av HR:171).
