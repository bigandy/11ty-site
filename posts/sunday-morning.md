Good morning to all out there on this beautiful brilliantly cold ice-blue Sunday morning! On the stereo is Mercury Rev's "All is But a Dream" and I've just finished a glass of delicious orange juice. Recently I have been quite busy learning more about wordpress and how to customise it further. How to add custom javascript libraries, custom CSS. All that's happening can be seen over at my [test blog](http://www.test.big-andy.co.uk/blog). I am using the starkers HTML5 theme as a starting point and also using the HTML5 boilerplate CSS reset so that I am working from a base-line so that any changes I make make it mine even more. Experimenting with CSS3 and also learning more about PHP and how PHP is implemented in wordpress. Yes I am having a great time! Outside the air is cold and frost lies on the ground and inside I wonder if it's now time to have some breakfast, time to get moving onwards with the day and then do some studying (I am revising for the final module of my Masters CIW course).
