yes. I went running this lunchtime. and for the first time this year I didn't kill myself doing it. There were only four of us due to the torrential rain in the morning, and a clash with the re-scheduled swimming club, but it was good fun. Never run this route this direction before, always finished with the killer hill up from the Thames... we started with that, then a steady flow along the flat parallel with the hill before diving into the woods for a non-stop killer hill run before a flat muddy field mud-skate hobble back to base. The air was warm and the sky blue. In the ultraworld the beatles are still scribbling in their mindless sleep. I finished "Sputnik Sweatheart" by Haruki Murakami last night, started "A Tramp Abroad" by Mark Twain, right excellent book that was... and it featured cats! Love, longing, loss, friendship and rejection... kept guessing how it would end and blown away by the ending, not what you'd have thought, or me.
