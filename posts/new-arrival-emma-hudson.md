We are proud and happy to announce the arrival of our Emma Hudson born on 29th May weighing 3.0kg. I’ve just returned back to work after 2 weeks paternity leave. Her big brother Arthur is super proud! Summer is here and we're applying for a passport so that we can visit the grandparents and extended family in France.
