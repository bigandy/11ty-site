It seems to me that the future of front-end development is with JavaScript and that now is a good time to become much better at writing and using it. So to aid my knowledge I've just started to read the book [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) by Douglas Crockford. I am also starting to learn about the [Backbone.js library](http://http://backbonejs.org/). I spoke to a colleague today in the JS team here at work and he said the best way to learn about it is to make something with it so hopefully soon I'll have something to show!
